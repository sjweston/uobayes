<h1>Course description<a href="#course-description" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h1>
<p>This advanced statistics course introduces students to Bayesian methods with a focus on practical application using modern computational tools. Through a combination of theoretical foundations and hands-on programming, students learn to build, interpret, and critique Bayesian models using the R programming language, with particular emphasis on the brms package.</p>

<p>This course is a mix of asynchronous lectures, in-class activities, and homework assignments.</p>
<p>Before each class, you will watch a video lecture. These will be posted here alongside each lecture.</p>
<p>At the beginning of each class, there will be a short quiz to check your understanding of the lecture and help me know what to review.</p>
<p>Class time will be used for in-class activities, including group work and discussion.</p>
<p>Each week will have a homework assignment. These will be posted here.</p>
<p>You can find all the materials for each week in the week’s chapter.</p>

<p>If you have questions about course policies, have trouble submitting an assignment, or want to schedule a meeting, please email. I will make an effort to respond to emails within one business day. Note that I neither plan nor commit to checking email outside of normal business hours (9am-5pm, Mon-Fri).</p>
<p>If you are having trouble understanding a concept covered in class, please come to office hours, schedule a meeting with me, or ask for clarification during class periods. I will not explain course concepts over email.</p>
<p>Occasionally, I will send out announcements to the entire class via Canvas announcements. These will typically appear when you open Canvas, but you can update your Canvas settings to receive these announcements as emails. It is strongly recommended that you do so.</p>

<p>All members of the class (students and instructor) can expect to:</p>
<p><em>Participate and Contribute:</em> All students are expected to participate by sharing ideas and contributing to the learning environment. This entails preparing, following instructions, and engaging respectfully and thoughtfully with others.</p>
<p>While all students should participate, participation is not just talking, and a range of participation activities support learning. Participation might look like speaking aloud in the full class and in small groups and collaborating on homework assignments.</p>
<p><em>Expect and Respect Diversity:</em> All classes at the University of Oregon welcome and respect diverse experiences, perspectives, and approaches. What is not welcome are behaviors or contributions that undermine, demean, or marginalize others based on race, ethnicity, gender, sex, age, sexual orientation, religion, ability, or socioeconomic status. We will value differences and communicate disagreements with respect.</p>
<p><em>Help Everyone Learn:</em> Part of how we learn together is by learning from one another. To do this effectively, we need to be patient with each other, identify ways we can assist others, and be open-minded to receiving help and feedback from others. Don’t hesitate to contact me to ask for assistance or offer suggestions that might help us learn better.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.5.3</span> Workload<a href="#workload" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>This is a 3-credit hour course, so you should expect to complete 120 hours of work for the course—an average of about 12 hours each week (this includes time in-class).</p>
</div>
<div id="generative-ai" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="0.5.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.5.4</span> Generative AI<a href="#generative-ai" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>While generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Cursor) can be useful for assisting with certain tasks, it’s important to use these technologies responsibly and ethically.</p>
<p>Good uses of AI:</p>
<ul>
<li>exploring concepts, generating code ideas, and providing explanations for topics covered in the course. These tools can help clarify difficult concepts, debug code, or suggest alternative approaches to data analysis.</li>
<li>create preliminary drafts of code, data analysis plans, or written reports. However, all AI-generated output must be reviewed, tested, and critically evaluated by the student. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy and appropriateness of all content before submitting it.
-brainstorm research questions, identify key terms, or help summarize complex literature related to data analysis. However, students should verify any factual claims independently by consulting primary sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bad uses of AI:</p>
<ul>
<li>generate entire assignments, projects, or reports. This includes writing whole essays, coding entire projects, or automating data analysis tasks without manual oversight. Any such use will be considered academic misconduct.</li>
<li>be used in place of collaborating with peers.</li>
<li>submitting AI-generated content without proper attribution or passing it off as entirely your own work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students who use AI tools in their coursework must include a brief statement at the end of their submission describing how and where the tool was used. For example: Generative AI was used to suggest the structure of the code in the data visualization section. Failure to disclose AI use may result in a grade reduction or further disciplinary action.</p>
<p>Generative AI can be a helpful resource when used responsibly, but students must actively engage in their learning process. Reliance on AI at the expense of developing your own analytical skills will likely lead to poor performance, not just in this course, but your career more broadly.</p>
<p>[Note: Generative AI was used to suggest the components of this policy.]</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.5.5</span> Cheating and Plagiarism<a href="#cheating-and-plagiarism" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Frankly, you’re in graduate school, and the purpose of work is to create opportunities to learn and improve. Even if cheating helps you in the short term, you’ll quickly find yourself ill-prepared for the career you have chosen. If you find yourself tempted to cheat, please come speak to Dr. Weston about an extension and developing tools to improve your success.</p>
