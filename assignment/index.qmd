## Daily quizzes

Quizzes will be completed in class using Poll Everywhere. 


## Problem sets

There will be a weekly problem set. These are due the Monday following each week. (For example, the problem set for Week 1 is due Monday of Week 2.) There is a one-week grace period for late assignments. All assignments are scored on completion, not on accuracy.
