## Questions

1. Suppose the globe tossing experiment turned out to be 3 water and 11 land. Construct the posterior distribution.

```{r}
# Create a sequence of p values from 0 to 1
p_grid <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 1000)

# Prior (uniform)
prior <- rep(1, 1000)

# Likelihood (binomial)
likelihood <- dbinom(3, size = 14, prob = p_grid)

# Posterior (proportional to likelihood * prior)
posterior <- likelihood * prior
posterior <- posterior / sum(posterior)

# Plot the posterior
plot(p_grid, posterior, type = "l", 
     xlab = "Proportion of water (p)", 
     ylab = "Posterior probability",
     main = "Posterior distribution for p")
```

The posterior distribution shows the probability of different values of p (proportion of water) given our data (3 water, 11 land). Since we used a uniform prior, the posterior is proportional to the likelihood. The peak of the distribution is around p = 0.21, which makes sense given our data (3/14 â‰ˆ 0.21).

2. Using the posterior distribution from **1**, compute the posterior predictive distribution for the next 5 tosses of the globe.

```{r}
# Number of samples from posterior
n_samples <- 10000

# Sample p values from posterior
p_samples <- sample(p_grid, prob = posterior, size = n_samples, replace = TRUE)

# Generate predictions for 5 tosses
n_tosses <- 5
predictions <- rbinom(n_samples, size = n_tosses, prob = p_samples)

# Plot the posterior predictive distribution
hist(predictions, 
     xlab = "Number of water in 5 tosses",
     ylab = "Count",
     main = "Posterior predictive distribution",
     breaks = seq(-0.5, 5.5, by = 1))
```

The posterior predictive distribution shows the probability of different outcomes for the next 5 tosses, taking into account our uncertainty about p. The most likely outcome is 1 water (since our posterior mean for p is around 0.21, we expect about 1 water in 5 tosses). The distribution is right-skewed because p is less than 0.5.
