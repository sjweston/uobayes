	abstract = {Partialing is a statistical approach researchers use with the goal of removing extraneous variance from a variable before examining its association with other variables. Controlling for confounds through analysis of covariance or multiple regression analysis and residualizing variables for use in subsequent analyses are common approaches to partialing in clinical research. Despite its intuitive appeal, partialing is fraught with undesirable consequences when predictors are correlated. After describing effects of partialing on variables, we review analytic approaches commonly used in clinical research to make inferences about the nature and effects of partialed variables. We then use two simulations to show how partialing can distort variables and their relations with other variables. Having concluded that, with rare exception, partialing is ill-advised, we offer recommendations for reducing or eliminating problematic uses of partialing. We conclude that the best alternative to partialing is to define and measure constructs so that it is not needed.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE — We developed a ﬁeld procedure using personal digital assistant (PDA) technology to test the hypothesis that naturally occurring episodes of hypo- and hyperglycemia are associated with deterioration in cognitive function in children with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — A total of 61 children aged 6 –11 years with type 1 diabetes received a PDA programmed with two brief cognitive tests (mental math and choice reaction time), which they completed just before home glucose readings. The computer recorded time to complete each test and number of correct responses. Children completed several trials per day over 4 – 6 weeks for a total of 70 trials. Performance variables were compared across glucose ranges. Individual impairment scores (IISs) were also computed for each child by calculating the SD between performance during euglycemia and that during glucose extremes.
RESULTS — Time to complete both mental math and reaction time was signiﬁcantly longer during hypoglycemia. During hyperglycemia, time to complete math was signiﬁcantly longer and reaction time was marginally signiﬁcant (P ϭ 0.053). There were no differences on task accuracy. Decline in mental math performance was equivalent at glucose levels Ͻ3.0 and Ͼ22.2 mmol/l. IISs varied greatly across children, with no age or sex differences.
CONCLUSIONS — A decrease in mental efﬁciency occurs with naturally occurring hypoand hyperglycemic glucose ﬂuctuations in children with type 1 diabetes, and this effect can be detected with a ﬁeld procedure using PDA technology. With blood glucose levels Ͼ22.2 mmol/l, cognitive deterioration equals that associated with signiﬁcant hypoglycemia.},

	abstract = {Objective: The primary aim was to evaluate the extent to which persons with type 1 diabetes perform selfmonitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) according to guidelines. Secondary objectives were to investigate predictors for good SMBG adherence, reasons for non-adherence, and association between SMBG frequency and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).
Methods: This was a survey-based cross-sectional study. Questionnaires were sent out to 600 random patients at five sites. Patients were included if they were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and ≥18 years old and excluded if they were currently using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Analysis of data was performed separately for the three sites where the answer frequency was ≥70\%.
Results: In total, 138 of 314 study participants, 43.9\% (95\% CI 38.5\% to 49.4\%) performed SMBG ≥4 times per day. For the three clinics where ≥70\% of surveyed patients were included in the analysis, results were similar, 41.3\% (95\% CI 34.7\% to 47.8\%). Top three reported reasons for not performing more frequent SMBG were lack of time, not remembering, and self-consciousness. Frequency of SMBG was associated with HbA1c levels ( p{\textless}0.0001). 30\% of patients believed that ≤3 SMBG/day was recommended by healthcare providers.
Conclusions: Less than 50\% of patients in Sweden follow guidelines of SMBG ≥4 times per day, despite glucose meters and strips being generally available at no cost. This indicates a need for further support in performing SMBG and increased availability of other tools for glucose monitoring.},

The purpose of this research is to further demonstrate the validity and reliability of the Self-Care Inventory (SCI), a youth and parent report measure of adherence with diabetes self-care behaviors. The SCI was chosen given its ease of implementation, applicability to multiple diabetes regimens, and dual parent/youth formats. Methods Participants were 164 youth with type 1 diabetes and a parent. Measures were administered at regular office visits to a tertiary care diabetes clinic. Results The SCI has strong psychometric properties, including adequate internal consistency, parent–youth agreement, and test-retest agreement. Relations between the SCI and a structured interview of diabetes adherence (the Diabetes Self-Management Profile; DSMP) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were strong. Conclusions In addition to demonstrating strong psychometrics, this research provides independent support for the SCI. Thus, the SCI is consistent with recent criteria proposed by Quittner et al. (Journal of Pediatric Psychology, 33, 916–936) for an empirically supported measure of regimen adherence. Although other methods of accessing adherence may provide more comprehensive assessments, the brevity, ease-of-implementation, and robustness for multiple regimens makes the SCI an ideal tool for clinicians and researchers.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE — Using a proﬁle-based approach to the assessment of diabetes management, the purpose of this study was to identify and evaluate an empirically derived classiﬁcation system of distinct self-management styles. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Youth with type 1 diabetes (n ϭ 156) aged 10 –16 years and their parents were administered a modiﬁed version of the Diabetes SelfManagement Proﬁle (DSMP). Cluster analyses were performed independently on parent and youth report forms to categorize patients based on their patterns of scores in ﬁve diabetes self-management areas.
RESULTS — Cluster analyses revealed three self-management styles that emerged from both youth and parent report: a “methodical style” (33\%) with an emphasis on careful meal planning and correct insulin administration; an “adaptive style” (46\%), characterized by high rates of blood glucose testing, exercise, and self-care adjustments; and an “inadequate style” (21\%) with moderate rates of self-care adjustments and otherwise low DSMP scores. Convergence between parent and youth report classiﬁcations was moderate (Cohen’s ␬ ϭ 0.47, P Ͻ 0.0001). A1C was 1.6\% higher in the inadequate style group than in both other groups (P Ͻ 0.0001), and the classiﬁcation signiﬁcantly accounted for differences in A1C above what was explained by an overall DSMP score.
CONCLUSIONS — The ﬁndings provide support for recognizing subgroups of patients with unique multidimensional patterns of self-care behaviors. The assessment of self-management styles may prove useful for customized treatments that are targeted directly to the patients’ needs.},

	abstract = {The concept of self-management of type 1 diabetes in children and adolescents: an evolutionary concept analysis Aim. An evolutionary concept analysis was undertaken to clarify the concept of self-management of type 1 diabetes in children and adolescents. Background. Several problems exist in the literature on self-management of type 1 diabetes in children and adolescents. There is no uniform terminology and there is no uniform definition of the concept. Also, there is no differentiation in the literature between self-management of diabetes in children and adults. Methods. Ninety-nine references were reviewed and analysed in the disciplines of nursing, medicine, and psychology. After separate analyses revealed no significant differences across disciplines, the analyses were combined to describe the attributes, antecedents, consequences, and surrogate and related concepts. Results. The three essential attributes of the concept were identified as process, activities, and goals. Self-management of type 1 diabetes in children and adolescents is an active and proactive process; it is daily, lifelong, and flexible, and it involves shifting and shared responsibility for diabetes care tasks and decision-making between child and parent. It is a process that involves collaboration with health care providers. Self-management of type 1 diabetes in children and adolescents also consists of varied and many activities related to giving insulin, monitoring metabolic control, regulating diet and exercise, to name just a few. The concept also involves goals, which may differ from one parent/child dyad to another. A working definition of the concept is suggested. Conclusions. It is hoped that a more uniform definition of the concept will enable researchers to continue investigating antecedents and consequences of the concept in a way that allows for aggregating results.},

	abstract = {Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious acute complication of type 1 diabetes, which is receiving more attention given the increased DKA risk associated with SGLT inhibitors. Sociodemographic and modifiable risk factors were identified with strong evidence for an increased risk of DKA, including socioeconomic disadvantage, adolescent age (13–25 years), female sex, high HbA1c, previous DKA, and psychiatric comorbidities (eg, eating disorders and depression). Possible prevention strategies, which include the identification of people at risk based on non-modifiable sociodemographic risk factors, are proposed. As a second risk mitigation strategy, structured diabetes self-management education that addresses modifiable risk factors can be used. Evidence has found that structured education leads to reduced DKA rates. Knowledge of these risk factors and potent risk mitigation strategies are important to identify subgroups of people with an elevated DKA risk. This knowledge should also be used when adjunct therapy options with an increased DKA risk are considered. Prevention of DKA in people with type 1 diabetes is an important clinical task, which should also be addressed when SGLT inhibitors are part of therapy.},

Self-efﬁcacy for diabetes management, expected outcomes of adherence, adherence to the diabetes regimen, and glycemic control were assessed in 168 adolescents (ages 10Y16 years) with type 1 diabetes. Factor analyses indicated a single scale for self-efﬁcacy and two distinct factors representing positive and negative outcome expectations. Reliability and predictive validity of the new scales were supported. In regression analyses, self-efﬁcacy and the interaction of self-efﬁcacy with expectations of positive outcomes were signiﬁcantly associated with diabetes self-management adherence and glycemic control in older adolescents. The effect of self-efﬁcacy was greatest when adolescents had stronger beliefs in the beneﬁcial outcomes of adherence. These brief measures can be used to identify youths at risk of poor diabetes self-management. Interventions targeting self-efﬁcacy may lead to improved diabetes self-management.

	abstract = {Research on major life events and personality change often focuses on the occurrence of speciﬁc life events such as childbirth, unemployment, or divorce. However, this typical approach has three important limitations: (1) Life events are typically measured categorically, (2) it is often assumed that people experience and change from the same event in the same way, and (3) external ratings of life events have unknown levels of validity. To address these limitations, we examined how common life events are typically perceived, how much perceptions of life events vary within events, and how well external ratings of events correspond to subjective ratings from people who experienced the events. We analyzed ratings of nine psychologically relevant characteristics of 10 common major life events from three different types of raters (N = 2,210). Each life event had a distinct subjectively rated proﬁle that corresponded well to external ratings. Collectively, this study demonstrates that life events can be meaningfully described and differentiated with event characteristics. However, people’s individual perceptions of life events varied considerably even within events. Therefore, research on major life events and their associations with personality change should incorporate individual perceptions of the events to advance the understanding of these associations.},

Analyses use data from the Midlife Development in the United States study, a national survey of more than 3,000 adults ages 25 to 74 in 1995. Compared to normal weight persons, obese II/III persons (body mass index of 35 or higher) are more likely to report institutional and day-to-day interpersonal discrimination. Among obese II/III persons, professional workers are more likely than nonprofessionals to report employment discrimination and interpersonal mistreatment. Obese II/III persons report lower levels of self-acceptance than normal weight persons, yet this relationship is fully mediated by the perception that one has been discriminated against due to body weight or physical appearance. Our findings offer further support for the pervasive stigma of obesity and the negative implications of stigmatized identities for life chances.},

The sample consisted of nationally representative young adults in college (n = 317) between 18 and 30 years of age who were diagnosed with T1DM. Data were collected during April 2017 using a secure electronic diabetes management survey to inquire about self-reported barriers to diabetes management, hypoglycemia, and diabetic ketoacidosis of members of a diabetes organization.ResultsStudents were evenly distributed from freshman to senior year of college with a slight decrease at the graduate level. Students who were affiliated members of a student-led diabetes student organization were less likely to report increased levels of isolation, depressive symptoms, and anxiety related to their diabetes than were general members.ConclusionParticipation in a university-based diabetes student organization on campus and connecting with other college students with diabetes may have health benefits. In conclusion, the current study underscores the potential importance of peer-led, diabetes-specific support for adolescents emerging into adulthood.},

Results suggest that the education level, stress, spirituality (religion) and optimism, social support from friends, and quality of life related to physical health seem to contribute positively to the PIL for both groups. However, some variables such as age, marital status and environmental quality of life help explain the PIL of retired people and the quality of life related to social support helps explain the PIL of working adults. Overall, the reported findings suggest that the purpose in life is strongly related to physical, psychological, social and environmental health factors. It is highlighted that working adults and retired people have their purpose in life related to similar factors and others specific to each life stage, suggesting the need for crucial interventions to promote a healthier and more positive aging process.},

	abstract = {Personality inventories are predominantly curated using factor analytic approaches. Indicators capturing common and thus redundant variance are preferentially selected, whereas indicators capturing a large proportion of unique variance outside the broad trait domains are omitted from further research. Even recent research dealing with lower-level personality traits such as facets or nuances has invariably relied on inventories founded on this factor analytic approach. However, items can also be selected to ensure low instead of high communality amongst them. The expected predictive power of such item sets is higher compared to those compiled to capitalize on the indicators? redundancy. To investigate this, we applied Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to select personality-descriptive adjectives with minimal inter-item correlations. When used to predict the frequency of everyday life behaviors, this ?crude-grit? set outperformed a traditional big-five item set and sets of randomly selected adjectives. The size of the predictive advantage of the crude-grit set was generally higher for those behaviors that could also be predicted better by the big-five item set. This study provides a proof-of-concept for an alternative procedure for compiling personality scales, and serves as a starting point for future studies using broader item sets.},

However, a methodological pitfall associated with common ?overall similarity? indices, which we term the normative-desirability confound (NDC), will regularly result in similarity constructs apparently having more positive effects than they do in reality. In essence, when an individual is estimated to be similar to another person by common indices, this will strongly indicate that the individual has desirable characteristics. Consequently, the correlates of overall similarity indices can often be interpreted as indicating the beneficial effects of having desirable characteristics, without needing to attribute any additional salutary effect to similarity. We show that this confound is present in overall similarity estimates for a wide range of constructs (e.g., personality traits, attitudes, emotions, behaviors, values), how it can be accounted for, and discuss larger implications for our understanding of similarity constructs.},

	abstract = {How do we best frame the problem of college student alcohol and drug use? Is it a problem that has been getting worse or better in recent years? Have the historical changes been specific to college students or more generally true of all in the 18- to 22-year-old age group? Indeed, is it more productive to view age 18-22 substance use as a college-specific issue or more of a time-of-life issue? What are the developmental trajectories of alcohol and drug use across the college years? How do these trajectories vary for those who drop out of, or never enroll in, college? And do the trajectories matter in terms of psychosocial adjustment? In this chapter, we consider these "big picture" questions, providing empirical evidence based on national multicohort panel data from the Monitoring the Future (MTF) study to frame college student substance use both historically and developmentally. We begin by providing an overview of historical variations, considering trends in several indices of substance use across three decades (1980-2009) as a function of college student status among national samples of young people 1 to 4 years post-high school. Then, after considering the developmental context that surrounds college transitions, we examine developmental trends in the two most common substances of abuse—alcohol and marijuana—from the senior year of high school through age 25 as a function of college status and of dropping out of college. Next, we examine different developmental trajectories of frequent heavy drinking (i.e., binge drinking), with particular attention given to college students who were not binge drinkers in high school. In the final section, we discuss theoretical and practical implications. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {The adolescent age period is often characterized as a health paradox because it is a time of extensive increases in physical and mental capabilities, yet overall mortality/morbidity rates increase significantly from childhood to adolescence, often due to preventable causes such as risk taking. Asynchrony in developmental time courses between the affective/approach and cognitive control brain systems, as well as the ongoing maturation of neural connectivity are thought to lead to increased vulnerability for risk taking in adolescence. A critical analysis of the frequency of risk taking behaviors, as well as mortality and morbidity rates across the lifespan, however, challenges the hypothesis that the peak of risk taking occurs in middle adolescence when the asynchrony between the different developmental time courses of the affective/approach and cognitive control systems is the largest. In fact, the highest levels of risk taking behaviors, such as alcohol and drug use, often occur among emerging adults (e.g., university/college students), and highlight the role of the social context in predicting risk taking behavior. Moreover, risk taking is not always unregulated or impulsive. Future research should broaden the scope of risk taking to include risks that are relevant to older adults, such as risky financial investing, gambling, and marital infidelity. In addition, a lifespan perspective, with a focus on how associations between neural systems and behavior are moderated by context and trait-level characteristics, and which includes diverse samples (e.g., divorced individuals), will help to address some important limitations in the adolescent brain development and risk taking literature.},

	abstract = {Objective: To provide a snapshot of the profile of adults and youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the United States and assessment of longitudinal changes in T1D management and clinical outcomes in the T1D Exchange registry.

Research Design and Methods: Data on diabetes management and outcomes from 22,697 registry participants (age 1–93 years) were collected between 2016 and 2018 and compared with data collected in 2010–2012 for 25,529 registry participants.

Results: Mean HbA1c in 2016–2018 increased from 65 mmol/mol at the age of 5 years to 78 mmol/mol between ages 15 and 18, with a decrease to 64 mmol/mol by age 28 and 58–63 mmol/mol beyond age 30. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) HbA1c goal of {\textless}58 mmol/mol for youth was achieved by only 17\% and the goal of {\textless}53 mmol/mol for adults by only 21\%. Mean HbA1c levels changed little between 2010–2012 and 2016–2018, except in adolescents who had a higher mean HbA1c in 2016–2018. Insulin pump use increased from 57\% in 2010–2012 to 63\% in 2016–2018. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) increased from 7\% in 2010–2012 to 30\% in 2016–2018, rising {\textgreater}10-fold in children {\textless}12 years old. HbA1c levels were lower in CGM users than nonusers. Severe hypoglycemia was most frequent in participants ≥50 years old and diabetic ketoacidosis was most common in adolescents and young adults. Racial differences were evident in use of pumps and CGM and HbA1c levels.

Conclusions: Data from the T1D Exchange registry demonstrate that only a minority of adults and youth with T1D in the United States achieve ADA goals for HbA1c.},

This study provides unique insights by examining week-by-week data that consisted of 12,529 total responses from 882 undergraduates during their first semester of college. Fixed-effects regression analyses were used to examine the extent to which weekly changes in students’ experiences and interpersonal relationships predicted corresponding changes in adjustment outcomes. Social connection, relationship satisfaction with college friends, and feeling successful in class were most strongly related to changes in belonging and well-being. Some experiences that are often overlooked in higher education research were also significant predictors; specifically, time spent exercising and relationship satisfaction with parents were associated with more favorable outcomes, whereas extensive social media use was associated with poorer outcomes. Implications for research and practice are discussed.},

The recommendations presented here are based on our own clinical experiences as endocrinologists, our personal experiences living with T1D using rtCGM, and findings from a recent survey of T1D patients who have successfully used rtCGM in their self-management. It is important that both clinicians and people with diabetes understand the utility and limitations of rtCGM.

Using Self-Determination Theory (SDT), we assessed six distinct types of motivation among an initial sample of 776 students at four time points over the first year of college. Latent growth models indicated initially high but declining levels of intrinsic motivation and identified regulation, moderate but increasing levels of positive and negative introjection, and low but increasing levels of external regulation and amotivation. These patterns suggest that, on average, more autonomous types of motivation tend to decrease over the first year of college while more controlled types of motivation tend to increase. Academic functioning was predicted by (a) initial levels of both identified regulation and amotivation and (b) change trajectories for intrinsic motivation, identified regulation, and amotivation. These findings suggest that contextual supports for building autonomous motivation and minimizing amotivation appear to be essential both prior to college entry and throughout the first year.},

There are many barriers to device uptake and continued use. There is a need to understand patient-specific characteristics when considering CGM. We evaluated patterns of CGM use and associations between baseline psychosocial measures and frequency of CGM use over 1 year., Methods: Youth with T1D (n = 120), ages 8–18 years, completed questionnaires at CGM initiation and after 6 and 12 months assessing depressive symptoms, diabetes burden, and diabetes-specific and generic quality of life (QOL)., Results: Youth (51\% male and 95\% white) had mean age 12.7 ± 2.7 years, diabetes duration 6.1 ± 3.6 years, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 8.0 ± 0.8\%. Over 1 year, 35\% of youth used CGM 6 to 7 days per week, 45\% used CGM 3–5 days per week, and 20\% used CGM only 0–2 days per week. Youth who used CGM 3–7 days per week over 12 months had lower HbA1c at months 9 and 12 than youth who used CGM 0–2 days per week (9 months: 7.9 ± 0.9\% vs. 8.5 ± 1.1\%, P = 0.006 and 12 months: 8.0 ± 0.9\% vs. 8.5 ± 1.1\%, P = 0.02). Those using CGM 0–2 days per week had greater endorsement of depressive symptoms and diabetes burden and reported lower QOL at baseline compared with those using CGM 3–7 days per week., Conclusions: CGM use for 3 or more days per week over 12 months had a protective effect on HbA1c. Providers should consider addressing psychosocial parameters when initiating CGM to maximize uptake and promote continued use in youth with T1D.},

	abstract = {Background
Despite significant advances in type 1 diabetes (T1D) management, achieving targeted glycemic control in pediatric patients remains a struggle. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) with remote access holds the promise to address this challenge by allowing caregivers to monitor glucose, even when the child is not directly under their supervision.

Objective
To explore real-time and remote CGM practices in homes and schools, including caregiver expectations regarding this technology.

Subjects
Parents and daytime caregivers.

Methods
Respondents answered an anonymous survey assessing characteristics of CGM use. Cross-sectional data were collected and analyzed using quantitative and qualitative methods.

Results
Thirty-three parents and 17 daytime caregivers responded. Threshold alerts (alerts when patients reached certain pre-set high or low limits) were used most frequently, followed by rate of change alerts. Most parents and daytime caregivers responded to low and high threshold CGM alerts by confirming with a glucose meter prior to treatment; while about one-third endorsed treating lows without a confirmatory test. Most parents expected their child’s daytime caregiver to respond to CGM alerts and daytime caregivers felt the parent’s expectations of them were reasonable. All parents and most caregivers reported decreased overall worry/stress. Parents felt positive about CGM use and daytime caregivers felt comfortable with CGM.

Conclusion
The positive and collaborative management reported by parents and daytime caregivers sets the stage for CGM to play an important role in the management of children with T1D both in the home and school settings.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE
To assess the frequency of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device use, factors associated with its use, and the relationship of CGM with diabetes outcomes (HbA1c, severe hypoglycemia [SH], and diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Survey questions related to CGM device use 1 year after enrollment in the T1D Exchange clinic registry were completed by 17,317 participants. Participants were defined as CGM users if they indicated using real-time CGM during the prior 30 days.

RESULTS
Nine percent of participants used CGM (6\% of children {\textless}13 years old, 4\% of adolescents 13 to {\textless}18 years, 6\% of young adults 18 to {\textless}26 years, and 21\% of adults ≥26 years). CGM use was more likely with higher education, higher household income, private health insurance, longer duration of diabetes, and use of insulin pump (P {\textless} 0.01 all factors). CGM use was associated with lower HbA1c in children (8.3\% vs. 8.6\%, P {\textless} 0.001) and adults (7.7\% vs. 7.9\%, P {\textless} 0.001). In adults, more frequent use of CGM (≥6 days/week) was associated with lower mean HbA1c. Only 27\% of users downloaded data from their device at least once per month, and ≤15\% of users reported downloading their device at least weekly. Among participants who used CGM at baseline, 41\% had discontinued within 1 year.

CONCLUSIONS
CGM use is uncommon but associated with lower HbA1c in some age-groups, especially when used more frequently. Factors associated with discontinuation and infrequent use of retrospective analysis of CGM data should be considered in developing next-generation devices and education on CGM use.},

However, despite evidence supporting the role of glucose monitoring in better patient health outcomes, studies also reveal relatively poor adherence rates to SMBG and CGM use and numerous patient-reported barriers. Fortunately, some promising intervention strategies have been identified that promote at least short-term improvements in patients? adherence to SMBG. These include education, problem solving, contingency management, goal setting, cognitive behavioral therapy, and motivational interviewing. Specific to CGM, interventions to promote greater use among patients are currently under way, yet one pilot study provides data suggesting better maintenance of CGM use in patients showing greater readiness for behavior change. The purpose of this review is to summarize the literature specific to glucose monitoring in patients with diabetes focusing specifically on current adherence rates, barriers to monitoring, and promising intervention strategies that may be ready to deploy now in the clinic setting to promote greater patient adherence to glucose monitoring. Yet, to continue to help patients with diabetes adhere to glucose monitoring, future research is needed to identify the treatment strategies and the intervention schedules that most likely lead to long-term maintenance of optimal glycemic monitoring levels.},

	abstract = {Background:
Youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are encouraged to participate in physical activity (PA). Studies have identified fear of hypoglycemia (FOH) as a barrier to participating in PA.

Objectives:
To examine 1) PA patterns in youth with T1D by age group and 2) the relationship between both parental and youth FOH and youth PA.

Methods:
A cross-sectional analysis from the SEARCH cohort study visit of youth ages 10-17 years with T1D (n=1,129) was conducted. Linear regression models estimated the association between self-reported number of days of vigorous PA (VPA) and moderate PA (MPA) and both youth- and parent-reported FOH. Multivariable models were adjusted for age, sex, race, duration of T1D, HbA1c, use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), recent severe hypoglycemia, primary insulin regimen, and BMI.

Results:
Participants were 52\% female, had mean (sd) age 14.4 (4.2) years, diabetes duration 7.5 years (1.8), HbA1c 9.2\% (1.7). Older youth were less likely to engage in VPA (p{\textless}.01), or sports teams (p{\textless}.01), but more likely to engage in MPA (p{\textless}.01). Higher youth FOH (behavior subscale) was associated with increased levels of VPA (β (se) 0.30 (0.11), p=.01) but not significantly associated with MPA (p=.06). There was no statistically significant association between parental FOH and youth PA.

Conclusions:
In SEARCH participants with T1D, VPA and team sports participation declined with age, while MPA increased. We observed that higher scores on the youth FOH behavioral subscale were associated with increased VPA levels, suggesting that FOH may be less of a barrier to PA than previously thought.},

	abstract = {Background: Sustained self-monitoring and self-management behaviors are crucial to maintain optimal health for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). As smartphones and mobile health (mHealth) devices become widely available, self-monitoring using mHealth devices is an appealing strategy in support of successful self-management of T2DM. However, research indicates that engagement with mHealth devices decreases over time. Thus, it is important to understand engagement trajectories to provide varying levels of support that can improve self-monitoring and self-management behaviors.
Objective: The aims of this study were to develop (1) digital phenotypes of the self-monitoring behaviors of patients with T2DM based on their engagement trajectory of using multiple mHealth devices, and (2) assess the association of individual digital phenotypes of self-monitoring behaviors with baseline demographic and clinical characteristics.
Methods: This longitudinal observational feasibility study included 60 participants with T2DM who were instructed to monitor their weight, blood glucose, and physical activity using a wireless weight scale, phone-tethered glucometer, and accelerometer, respectively, over 6 months. We used  latent class growth analysis (LCGA) with multitrajectory modeling to associate the digital phenotypes of participants’ self-monitoring behaviors based on their engagement trajectories with multiple mHealth devices. Associations between individual characteristics and digital phenotypes on participants’ self-monitoring behavior were assessed by analysis of variance or the Chi square test.
Results: The engagement with accelerometers to monitor daily physical activities was consistently high for all participants over time. Three distinct digital phenotypes were identified based on participants’ engagement with the wireless weight scale and glucometer: (1) low and waning engagement group (24/60, 40\%), (2) medium engagement group (20/60, 33\%), and (3) consistently high engagement group (16/60, 27\%). Participants that were younger, female, nonwhite, had a low income, and with a higher baseline hemoglobin A1c level were more likely to be in the low and waning engagement group.
Conclusions: We demonstrated how to digitally phenotype individuals’ self-monitoring behavior based on their engagement trajectory with multiple mHealth devices. Distinct self-monitoring behavior groups were identified. Individual demographic and clinical characteristics were associated with different self-monitoring behavior groups. Future research should identify methods to provide tailored support for people with T2DM to help them better monitor and manage their condition.},

          This study investigated between- and within-person associations among mean levels and variability in affect, diabetes self-care behaviors, and continuously monitored glucose in Latinos with type 2 diabetes.
          Methods 
          Fifty participants (M [SD] age = 57.8 [11.7] years, 74\% women, mean [SD] glycosylated hemoglobin A1c = 8.3\% [1.5\%]) wore a “blinded” continuous glucose monitor for 7 days, and they responded to twice daily automated phone surveys regarding positive affect, negative affect, and self-care behaviors.
          Results 
          Higher mean levels of NA were associated with higher mean glucose (r = .30), greater percent hyperglycemia (r = .34) and greater percentage of out-of-range glucose (r = .34). Higher NA variability was also related to higher mean glucose (r = .34), greater percent of hyperglycemia (r = .44) and greater percentage of out-of-range glucose (r = .43). Higher positive affect variability was related to lower percentage of hypoglycemia (r = −.33). Higher mean levels of self-care behaviors were related to lower glucose variability (r = −.35). Finally, higher self-care behavior variability was related to greater percentage of hyperglycemia (r = .31) and greater percentage of out-of-range glucose (r = −.28). In multilevel regression models, within-person increases from mean levels of self-care were associated with lower mean levels of glucose (b = −7.4, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = −12.8 to −1.9), lower percentage of hyperglycemia (b = −0.04, 95\% CI = −0.07 to −0.01), and higher percentage of hypoglycemia (b = 0.02, 95\% CI = 0.01 to 0.03) in the subsequent 10-hour period.

          Near-to-real time sampling documented associations of glucose with affect and diabetes self-care that are not detectable with traditional measures.},

	abstract = {We developed a novel conceptualization of one component of creativity in narratives by integrating creativity theory and distributional semantics theory. We termed the new construct divergent semantic integration (DSI), defined as the extent to which a narrative connects divergent ideas. Across nine studies, 27 different narrative prompts, and over 3500 short narratives, we compared six models of DSI that varied in their computational architecture. The best-performing model employed Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), which generates context-dependent numerical representations of words (i.e., embeddings). BERT DSI scores demonstrated impressive predictive power, explaining up to 72\% of the variance in human creativity ratings, even approaching human inter-rater reliability for some tasks. BERT DSI scores showed equivalently high predictive power for expert and nonexpert human ratings of creativity in narratives. Critically, DSI scores generalized across ethnicity and English language proficiency, including individuals identifying as Hispanic and L2 English speakers. The integration of creativity and distributional semantics theory has substantial potential to generate novel hypotheses about creativity and novel operationalizations of its underlying processes and components. To facilitate new discoveries across diverse disciplines, we provide a tutorial with code (osf.io/ath2s) on how to compute DSI and a web app (osf.io/ath2s) to freely retrieve DSI scores.},

In this article, we argue that the study of relationships and health can move toward interrogating these mechanisms with greater precision and detail, but doing so will require a shift in the nature of commonly used research methods in this area. Accordingly, we draw heavily on the science of behavior change and discuss six key methodologies that may galvanize the mechanistic study of relationships and health: dismantling studies, factorial studies, experimental therapeutics, experimental mediation research, multiple assessments, and recursive modeling. We provide empirical examples for each strategy and outline new ways in which a given approach may be used to study the mechanisms linking intimate relationships and health. We conclude by discussing the key challenges and limitations for using these research strategies as well as novel ideas about how to integrate this work into existing paradigms within the field.},

We develop a novel generative statistical model of US districtlevel congressional elections, validate it with extensive out-of-sample tests, and use it to compute the first correctly calibrated probabilities of incumbent losses, one of the most important quantities for evaluating a democracy. We find that even when marginals vanish, incumbency advantage grows, and other dramatic changes occur, the risk of an out-party incumbent losing a midterm election contest has been high and essentially constant since the 1950s. We then develop a broader theory of American democracy consistent with the results from our generative model and discuss the broader implications of our generative modeling strategy.},

If a given emotion is a natural kind and can be identified objectively, then it is possible to make discoveries about that emotion. Indeed, the scientific study of emotion is founded on this assumption. In this article, I review the accumulating empirical evidence that is inconsistent with the view that there are kinds of emotion with boundaries that are carved in nature.

	abstract = {Psychological research on socioeconomic status (SES) has grown significantly over the past decade. In this article, we build upon and integrate existing approaches to direct greater attention toward investigating the subjective meaning and value that people attach to understanding their own SES as an identity. We use the term status-based identity to organize relevant research and examine how people understand and make meaning of their SES from moment to moment in real time. Drawing from multiple areas of research on identity, we suggest that even temporary shifts in how people construe their status-based identities predict changes in thought, affect, motivation, and behavior. This novel focus is positioned to examine the psychological effects of status transitions (e.g., upward or downward mobility). Further, in initial empirical work, we introduce a new measure to assess uncertainty regarding one?s SES (i.e., status-based identity uncertainty) and offer evidence that greater uncertainty regarding one?s status-based identity is associated with lower individual well-being. In sum, we argue that insight from the literature on identity will both expand and serve to organize the burgeoning literature on the psychology of SES and, in so doing, reveal promising new directions for research.},

Research into the relation between life stories and adaptation shows that narrators who find redemptive meanings in suffering and adversity, and who construct life stories that feature themes of personal agency and exploration, tend to enjoy higher levels of mental health, well-being, and maturity. Researchers have tracked the development of narrative identity from its origins in conversations between parents and their young children to the articulation of sophisticated meaning-making strategies in the personal stories told in adolescence and the emerging adulthood years. Future researchers need to (a) disentangle causal relations between features of life stories and positive psychological adaptation and (b) explore further the role of broad cultural contexts in the development of narrative identity.},

Despite the advent of initiatives to increase transparency in research reporting, the field is still lacking tools to verify the credibility of research reports. In the present paper, we describe methodologies that let researchers craft highly credible research and allow their peers to verify this credibility. We demonstrate the application of these methods in a multi-laboratory replication of Bem's Experiment 1 (Bem 2011 J. Pers. Soc. Psychol.100, 407–425. (doi:10.1037/a0021524)) on extrasensory perception (ESP), which was co-designed by a consensus panel including both proponents and opponents of Bem's original hypothesis. In the study we applied direct data deposition in combination with born-open data and real-time research reports to extend transparency to protocol delivery and data collection. We also used piloting, checklists, laboratory logs and video-documented trial sessions to ascertain as-intended protocol delivery, and external research auditors to monitor research integrity. We found 49.89\% successful guesses, while Bem reported 53.07\% success rate, with the chance level being 50\%. Thus, Bem's findings were not replicated in our study. In the paper, we discuss the implementation, feasibility and perceived usefulness of the credibility-enhancing methodologies used throughout the project.},

	abstract = {Cronbach’s alpha (α) is the most widely reported metric of the reliability of psychological measures. Decisions about an observed α’s adequacy are often made using rule-of-thumb thresholds, such as α of at least .70. Such thresholds can put pressure on researchers to make their measures meet these criteria, similar to the pressure to meet the significance threshold with p values. We examined whether α values reported in the literature are inflated at the rule-of-thumb thresholds (α = .70, .80, .90), due to, for example, overfitting to in-sample data (α-hacking) or publication bias. We extracted reported α values from two very large literatures covering general psychology ({\textgreater}30,000 α taken from {\textgreater}74,000 published articles in APA journals) and Industrial and Organizational psychology ({\textgreater}89,000 α values taken from {\textgreater}14,000 published articles in I/O journals). The distributions of these values show inflation at the rule-of-thumb thresholds. We discuss the scope, causes and consequences of α-hacking and how increased transparency, preregistration of measurement strategy, and standardized protocols could mitigate this problem.},

	isbn = {978-0-470-13748-2},
	abstract = {This chapter began with a brief history of the self, noting that in recent decades social psychology has at long last embraced some seminal conceptions of the self offered by James (1890/1950) more than a century ago. The result of this neo-Jamesian approach to the self has been an unprecedented explosion of conceptual and methodological innovations that have breathed new life into the subarea. But if this sudden burst of creativity has had clear benefits, it has had costs as well. To us, the most worrisome risk is that the subarea will become so broad that it will begin to lose focus. Eventually, newcomers may begin to wonder whether there is any "there, there." To avert this unhappy outcome, we suggest setting a boundary condition for the subarea: Work on the self should involve some consideration of the self as a mental representation. A secondary concern is the lack of integration both within and across topic areas. This is understandable given the complexity of the subject matter and the resulting challenge of constructing meaningful integrations. Nevertheless, if the field is ever to develop a unified theory of the self, it is critical that theorists continue to forge connections among different themes in the literature. As future researchers rise to the challenge of forging such connections, they will build on the fundamental truths that are gradually emerging in the literature. One truth that has already been distilled is that the self is, as the symbolic interactionists have long emphasized (e.g., Stryker, 2000), a social phenomenon. From our first inklings of self-awareness to our final reflections on the meaning of life, our social interactions define, nurture, and alter our sense of self. This basic truth has given rise to a range of investigations that are continuing to provide crucial insights into the nature of the self. Many more such truths are within the grasp of contemporary self psychologists. Indeed, if our review of the literature has left us with a single impression, it is that as the topic area has increasingly attracted attention, the rate of scientific advances has accelerated proportionally. We are left with a strong feeling of optimism and a conviction that, in the future, the answers will come even faster. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

Ego's cognitive biases are egocentricity (self as the focus of knowledge), "beneffectance" (perception of responsibility for desired, but not undesired, outcomes), and cognitive conservatism (resistance to cognitive change). In addition to being pervasively evident in recent studies of normal human cognition, these three biases are found in actively functioning, higher level organizations of knowledge, perhaps best exemplified by theoretical paradigms in science. The thesis that egocentricity, beneffectance, and conservatism act to preserve knowledge organizations leads to the proposal of an intrapsychic analog of genetic evolution, which in turn provides an alternative to prevalent motivational and informational interpretations of cognitive biases.},

	abstract = {People use metaperceptions, or their beliefs about how other people perceive them, to initiate and maintain social bonds. Are accurate metaperceptions associated with higher quality relationships? In four studies, the current research answers this question but considers the possibility that the self might not experience the same relational benefits of accurate metaperceptions, or meta-accuracy, as the people who form judgments about the self. For example, people tend to like individuals who have accurate self-perceptions, yet individuals tend to enjoy their own relationships more with people they believe see them in desirable ways. To test whether meta-accuracy is linked to relationship quality and whether this link differs for the self and others, meta-accuracy for personality traits as well as metaperceiver- and judge-reported relationship quality were assessed among new acquaintances (N ϭ 184), peers (N ϭ 228), friends (N ϭ 273), and romantic partners (N ϭ 401). Results suggested that judges enjoyed relationships more with metaperceivers who knew the impression they made, regardless of whether judges’ impressions were desirable (i.e., positive or self-verifying). Initial meta-accuracy also predicted greater relationship quality over time, suggesting that accurate metaperceptions have positive effects on relationships. In contrast, rather than enjoying relationships more when they were accurate, metaperceivers enjoyed relationships more when they believed judges perceived them in positive or self-verifying ways. Thus, meta-accuracy seems to be a virtue in the eyes of judges, but metaperceivers do not seem to reap the same benefits of knowing what others really think. Implications for improving meta-accuracy are discussed.},

	abstract = {When consumers of science (readers and reviewers) lack relevant details about the study design, data, and analyses, they cannot adequately evaluate the strength of a scientific study. Lack of transparency is common in science, and is encouraged by journals that place more emphasis on the aesthetic appeal of a manuscript than the robustness of its scientific claims. In doing this, journals are implicitly encouraging authors to do whatever it takes to obtain eye-catching results. To achieve this, researchers can use common research practices that beautify results at the expense of the robustness of those results (e.g., p-hacking). The problem is not engaging in these practices, but failing to disclose them. A car whose carburetor is duct-taped to the rest of the car might work perfectly fine, but the buyer has a right to know about the duct-taping. Without high levels of transparency in scientific publications, consumers of scientific manuscripts are in a similar position as buyers of used cars – they cannot reliably tell the difference between lemons and high quality findings. This phenomenon – quality uncertainty – has been shown to erode trust in economic markets, such as the used car market. The same problem threatens to erode trust in science. The solution is to increase transparency and give consumers of scientific research the information they need to accurately evaluate research. Transparency would also encourage researchers to be more careful in how they conduct their studies and write up their results. To make this happen, we must tie journals’ reputations to their practices regarding transparency. Reviewers hold a great deal of power to make this happen, by demanding the transparency needed to rigorously evaluate scientific manuscripts. The public expects transparency from science, and appropriately so – we should be held to a higher standard than used car salespeople.},

I argue that causal interpretations require traits to be seen as existentially and holistically real and the associations to be independent of specific ways of operationalizing the traits. Among other things, this means that, to the extents that causality is to be ascribed to such holistic traits, items and facets of those traits should be similarly associated with specific outcomes, except for variability in the degrees to which they reflect the traits (i.e. factor loadings). I argue that, before drawing causal inferences about personality trait?outcome associations, the presence of this condition should be routinely tested by, for example, systematically comparing the outcome associations of individual items or facets, or sampling different indicators for measuring the same purported traits. Existing evidence suggests that observed associations between personality traits and outcomes at least sometimes depend on which particular items or facets have been included in trait operationalizations, calling trait?level causal interpretations into question. However, this has rarely been considered in the literature. I argue that when outcome associations are specific to facets, they should not be generalized to traits. Furthermore, when the associations are specific to particular items, they should not even be generalized to facets. Copyright ? 2016 European Association of Personality Psychology},

However, whether high-income US citizens have better health outcomes than average individuals in other developed countries is unknown.To assess whether the health outcomes of White US citizens living in the 1\% and 5\% richest counties (hereafter referred to as privileged White US citizens) are better than the health outcomes of average residents in other developed countries.This comparative effectiveness study, conducted from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2015, identified White US citizens living in the 1\% (n = 32) and 5\% (n = 157) highest-income counties in the US and measured the following 6 health outcomes associated with health care interventions: infant and maternal mortality, colon and breast cancer, childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia, and acute myocardial infarction. The study used Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development data, CONCORD-3 cancer data, and Medicare data to compare their outcomes with all residents in 12 other developed countries: Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland. Statistical analysis took place from July 25, 2017, to August 29, 2020.Infant mortality; maternal mortality; 5-year survival of patients with colon cancer, breast cancer, or childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia; and 30-day age-standardized case fatality after acute myocardial infarction.The infant mortality rate among White US citizens in the 5\% highest-income counties was 4.01 per 1000, and the maternal mortality rate among White US citizens in the 5\% highest-income counties was 10.85 per 100 000, both higher than the mean rates for any of the 12 comparison countries. (The infant mortality rate for the top 1\% counties was 3.54 per 1000, and the maternal mortality rate was 10.05 per 100 000.) The 5-year survival rate for White US citizens in the 5\% highest-income counties was 67.2\% (95\% CI, 66.7\%-67.7\%) for colon cancer, higher than that of average US citizens (64.9\% [95\% CI, 64.7\%-65.1\%]) and average citizens in 6 countries, comparable with that of average citizens in 4 countries, and lower than that of average citizens for 2 countries. The 5-year survival rate for breast cancer among White US women in the 5\% highest-income US counties was 92.0\% (95\% CI, 91.6\%-92.4\%), higher than in all 12 comparison countries. The 5-year survival rate for White children with acute lymphocytic leukemia in the 5\% highest-income US counties was 92.6\% (95\% CI, 90.7\%-94.2\%), exceeding the mean survival rate for only 1 country and comparable with the mean survival rates in 11 countries. The adjusted 30-day acute myocardial infarction case-fatality rate for White US citizens in the 5\% highest-income US counties was 8\% below the rate for all US citizens and was 5\% below the rate for all US citizens in the 1\% highest-income US counties; these estimates were similar to the median outcome of other high-income countries.This study suggests that privileged White US citizens have better health outcomes than average US citizens for 6 health outcomes but often fare worse than the mean measure of health outcomes of 12 other developed countries. These findings imply that even if all US citizens experienced the same health outcomes enjoyed by privileged White US citizens, US health indicators would still lag behind those in many other countries.},

Overall, there were more actor than partner effects, but partner effects were especially numerous for health outcomes.

Few actor-partner interactions emerged and partner similarity rarely moderated effects.

Although ERI development is understood as adaptive, particularly for young people of color, ethnicity and race related conversations are often highly charged, and can consist of both positive, self-affirming exchanges, as well as negative experiences of identity denial, disinterest, and discrimination. The valence of such conversations, and their role in ERI development, may relate both to what is being said and how the conversation is structured. The current study examines in vivo, unguided conversations between 36 friend pairs coded for mention of ethnicity and race (N = 64 individuals; 56\% women, 75\% born in the United States, M age = 20.54, SD = 2.73; ethnic composition: n = 11 ethnic-racial minority (EM)-EM, n = 14 EM-White, n = 9 White-White). Based on a two-step qualitative analysis, we found wide variation in conversation content and structure. Despite no differences in the length of ethnicity and race related discussion, the types of stories told were shaped starkly by ethnic-racial inequality, discrimination, and the largely segregated experiences of White students. We discuss our findings in light of the little investigated link between ERI exploration and maladaptive psychosocial outcomes.},

Extending this work to more diverse samples and contexts, across four studies, we examine whether colorblind norms link to the colorblind behavior of racially diverse participants living in a racially diverse (i.e., heterogeneous) context. Findings suggest that participants living in a racially diverse context did not endorse colorblind beliefs (Study 1) and norms (Study 2), and instead behaved in race-conscious ways and overwhelmingly used race in a photo identification task. Furthermore, in Study 3, we find that colorblind norms are largely activated by the belief that talking about race is prejudiced. When participants were exposed to a social norm that linked talking about race to prejudice, colorblind behavior became more prevalent. Finally, in Study 4, we see that greater diversity of one’s context is correlated to less endorsement of colorblindness.},

            Twitter and other social media platforms are believed to have altered the course of numerous historical events, from the Arab Spring to the US presidential election. Online social networks have become a ubiquitous medium for discussing moral and political ideas. Nevertheless, the field of moral psychology has yet to investigate why some moral and political ideas spread more widely than others. Using a large sample of social media communications concerning polarizing issues in public policy debates (gun control, same-sex marriage, climate change), we found that the presence of moral-emotional language in political messages substantially increases their diffusion within (and less so between) ideological group boundaries. These findings offer insights into how moral ideas spread within networks during real political discussion.
          , 
            
              Political debate concerning moralized issues is increasingly common in online social networks. However, moral psychology has yet to incorporate the study of social networks to investigate processes by which some moral ideas spread more rapidly or broadly than others. Here, we show that the expression of moral emotion is key for the spread of moral and political ideas in online social networks, a process we call “moral contagion.” Using a large sample of social media communications about three polarizing moral/political issues (
              n
              = 563,312), we observed that the presence of moral-emotional words in messages increased their diffusion by a factor of 20\% for each additional word. Furthermore, we found that moral contagion was bounded by group membership; moral-emotional language increased diffusion more strongly within liberal and conservative networks, and less between them. Our results highlight the importance of emotion in the social transmission of moral ideas and also demonstrate the utility of social network methods for studying morality. These findings offer insights into how people are exposed to moral and political ideas through social networks, thus expanding models of social influence and group polarization as people become increasingly immersed in social media networks.},

In this large-scale, population-based study of adults, we applied network analysis to study the relationship between environmental factors and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and wellbeing. We estimated networks with overall mental health nodes and individual symptoms to assess both broad- and fine-grained associations between environmental factors and mental health. Finally, we conducted an out-of-sample replication in an independent large-scale sample to assess the robustness of our results. Across 31,000 adults randomly sampled from the Norwegian population, we found evidence of key associations between environmental characteristics and mental health. Recent discrimination and unsupportive social environments were strongly associated with lower population wellbeing and higher levels of mental illness symptoms, respectively. The most strongly connected variables in the networks were environmental factors, including perceived problems with crime, violence, or vandalism in the residential area, worrying about violence or threats when outside, and problems with noise or contamination at home. Substantial variation in population mental health was explained by environmental factors included in the networks. Replicability of the results was excellent and indicative of strong robustness of the results across samples. Our findings highlight the importance of environmental factors, such as the social environment, housing satisfaction, and residential area characteristics, for multiple aspects of population mental health. We identify several environmental factors which represent potentially useful targets for future studies and public health efforts seeking to improve mental health in the general population.},

However, the method has disadvantages: Not only is it perceived as effortful and time-consuming, but reasonable deviations from the analysis plan demote the status of the study to exploratory. An alternative to preregistration is analysis blinding, in which researchers develop their analysis on an altered version of the data. In this experimental study, we compare the reported efficiency and convenience of the two methods in the context of the Many-Analysts Religion Project. In this project, 120 teams answered the same research questions on the same data set, either preregistering their analysis (n = 61) or using analysis blinding (n = 59). Our results provide strong evidence (Bayes factor [BF] = 71.40) for the hypothesis that analysis blinding leads to fewer deviations from the analysis plan, and if teams deviated, they did so on fewer aspects. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found strong evidence (BF = 13.19) that both methods required approximately the same amount of time. Finally, we found no and moderate evidence on whether analysis blinding was perceived as less effortful and frustrating, respectively. We conclude that analysis blinding does not mean less work, but researchers can still benefit from the method because they can plan more appropriate analyses from which they deviate less frequently.},

The ﬁrst is a reduction in the willingness of researchers, especially those young investigators confronting hiring and promotion issues, to undertake such ﬁeld work. The second is a reduction in the clarity with which nonacademic audiences (e.g., citizens and legislators) can see the relevance of academic psychology to their lives and self-interest, which has contributed to a concomitant reduction in the availability of federal funds for basic behavioral science.

The critique has 2 parts. First, the dominant model of science in the field is appropriate only for a well-developed science, in which basic, real-world phenomena have been identified, important invariances in these phenomena have been documented, and appropriate model systems that capture the essence of these phenomena have been developed. These requirements are not met for most of the phenomena under study in social psychology. Second, the model of science in use is a caricature of the actual scientific process in well-developed sciences such as biology. Such research is often not model or even hypothesis driven, but rather relies on “informed curiosity” to motivate research. Descriptive studies are considered important and make up a substantial part of the literature, and there is less exclusive reliance on experiment. The two parts of the critique are documented by analysis of articles in appropriate psychology and biology journals. The author acknowledges that important and high quality work is currently being done in social psychology, but believes that the field has maladaptively narrowed the range of the phenomena and methodological approaches that it deems acceptable or optimal.},

Results revealed that interactions that were social (vs. task‐oriented) and with close (vs. less close) others were associated with higher momentary happiness as were higher levels of the target person's extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, and lower neuroticism. Of the 10 personality × situation interactions tested, only one reached significance (with p = .041): Individuals with higher levels of neuroticism benefitted more from interactions with friends than did individuals low in neuroticism. The role of social context characteristics for momentary happiness changed with age, but the role of personality or personality × social context did not, suggesting that personality effects on happiness in social context manifest in similar ways across the adult lifespan.

	abstract = {It is well established that trait neuroticism bears strong links with negative affect and interpersonal problems. The goal of this study was to examine the longitudinal associations between neuroticism and daily experiences of negative affect and interpersonal problems during the developmentally important period of adolescence. Dutch adolescents and their best friends (N = 1,046) completed up to 6 yearly personality trait questionnaires and up to 15 between-year assessment bursts between the ages 13 and 18. During each assessment burst, participants reported on 5 consecutive days about their experiences of negative affect and interpersonal conflict with their mother and their best friend. We estimated a series of multilevel random-intercept cross-lagged panel models to differentiate covariance at the level of constant between-person differences from dynamic processes that occurred within persons. At the level of constant between-person differences, higher neuroticism was associated with more negative daily experiences. At the within-person level, yearly changes in neuroticism were bidirectionally and positively associated with yearly changes in daily negative affect. The most parsimonious, best fitting models did not contain a random intercept for daily conflict with friend and adolescents’ contingency between daily experiences of conflict with mother and negative affect. Rank-order differences in these variables were positively associated with subsequent within-person changes in neuroticism. We discuss these results with regard to endogenous versus dynamic theories of personality development and the value of using a differentiated statistical approach.},

	doi = {10.1111/spc3.12490},
	abstract = {Engel presented a compelling case for a biopsychosocial model of health. This challenged a biomedical model that he saw as reductionistic, physicalistic, and exclusionist. Yet despite its laudable goals and popularity, the biopsychosocial model can be faulted for being incremental, imprecise, and individualistic. Ultimately, this means it is no less reductionist than the biomedical model which it sought to supplant. In this paper, we present a reformulation of this model that foregrounds the capacity for social groups—and the social contexts in which those groups are embedded—to structure psychology and, through this, biology and health. This sociopsychobio model argues that the three elements of Engel's framework are not fixed and immutable but rather dynamic and interdependent. The model is consistent with a range of recent approaches to health that have focused on the important role that social class, social inequality, social structure, and social networks play in shaping health outcomes. In this paper, though, the concrete value of this reformulation is illustrated through a discussion of recent research that focuses on the role of group memberships and associated social identities in shaping the psychology and biology of stress. This review underlines two key points that are central to the general case for a sociopsychobio model of health. First, that groups are a force in the world that shape the psychology and biology of their members (as well as members of other groups) in ways that cannot be reduced to those group members' functioning as individuals. Second, that groups provide their members with a basis for seeking to change the world rather than simply accepting it. In this, group life is not merely an appendage to psychology and biology but is instead a basis for collective experiences that have the potential to unleash new expressions of both.},

Results suggested that the variation in the predictive validity of several FFM traits and facets across multiple performance criteria was attributable to second-order sampling error.

A micro‐longitudinal design (N = 331, adults aged 18–77) with daily assessments over two workweeks was employed to examine the relations between gratitude and two components of FTP (remaining opportunities and time). Three important results from random intercepts cross‐lagged panel models stand out. First, we found evidence for within‐person day‐to‐day carry‐over effects in FTP and gratitude. Second, FTP and gratitude were systematically related within and across individuals. Third, age and dispositional forms of FTP and gratitude predicted between‐person differences in FTP and gratitude in daily life. Finally, exploratory multilevel analyses have shown that the associations between daily FTP and gratitude vary across ages at the between‐person level but not at the within‐person level. Overall, these findings advance our understanding of perceptions of FTP in daily life and their associations with gratitude in adulthood. © 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology},

By integrating a web-based application programming interface for the statistical programming language R via OpenCPU, formr allows researchers to use a familiar programming language to enable complex features. These can range from adaptive testing, to graphical and interactive feedback, to integration with non-survey data sources such as self-trackers or online social network data.

As methods blogs, their posts mainly concern statistics, replication (particularly statistical power), and research findings. The few posts that mentioned individual researchers substantially focused on replication issues; they received more views, social-media impact, comments, and citations. Male individual researchers were mentioned much more often than female researchers. Further data can inform perspectives about these new channels of scientific communication, with the shared aim of improving scientific practices.},

However, empirical support for this theoretical notion is still limited. Furthermore, the classical approach of using retest correlations might not be fully capable of illustrating the full picture of personality stability (Hertzog \& Nesselroade, 1987). Recent methodological and theoretical advancements suggest that individual differences in personality might reflect both absolutely stable trait-like factors and partly stable changing factors (Anusic \& Schimmack, 2016). Here, we aimed to compare how retest correlations versus the stable and changing factors of the Big Five personality traits change across the adult life span. Using 3 waves of personality data from Germany (N = 9,013) and another 3 waves from Australia (N = 6,012), we estimated latent retest and trait–state-occasion models in a local structural-equation-modeling framework and tested for moderating effects of age on model-specific stability components. There were 3 main findings. First, the retest correlations indicated that inverted U-shaped patterns manifested only in part. Second, for all Big Five characteristics (except conscientiousness in Study 1), the stable trait variance was larger than the occasion-specific variance, indicating that reliable individual differences in personality are mostly due to the effects of stable factors. Third, moderating effects of age differed across the Big Five and across the 2 studies and generally showed only limited support for the cumulative continuity principle. We discuss possible theoretical and methodological implications.},

The sample consisted of cognitively impaired patients (N = 133), aged 50 and older, who came to a memory clinic due to cognitive complaints. The test procedure encompassed a cognitive screening, the Neuropsychological Test Battery Vienna (NTBV), and self-assessment questionnaires such as the Big Five Plus One Persönlichkeitsinventar (B5PO). While patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) did not differ from those with non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (naMCI) concerning the different personality traits, patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) showed significantly lower scores for extraversion (p {\textless} 0.05), openness (p {\textless} 0.001), and empathy (p {\textless} 0.001) than patients with SCD as well as patients with naMCI. Thus, cognitively impaired groups mainly differ concerning personality traits depending on whether they do show memory decline or not.},

This work examined whether personality traits and attitudes toward traits can explain this controversy. Data from 830 users of Vk.com, a Russian OSN were analysed. I hypothesised that extraversion and attitudes toward extraversion eliminated correlations between positive self-esteem and users' popularity (the number of friends and likes). In contrast, neuroticism and attitudes toward neuroticism failed to eliminate a negative correlation between self-esteem and an indicator of users' self-validation (the number of impersonal avatars). This association also remained significant when conscientiousness as well as negative attitudes toward conscientiousness and agreeableness were controlled. However, self-esteem did not correlate with the two other self-validation indicators―the number of posts and portraits. This study casts doubt on the possibility of direct associations between positive self-esteem and users' popularity beyond such factors as extraversion. Nevertheless, it lends partial support to the association between negative self-esteem and users' self-validation such as the use of impersonal avatars even when other personality characteristics are considered.},

Results showed that interests and personality traits were similarly stable over time, but showed different patterns of mean-level change. There was evidence of personality maturation but a lack of cumulative changes in interest levels. For the most part, gender differences in developmental trends were minimal. In addition, latent growth curve analyses revealed broad and specific correlated changes between personality and interests. Changes in general factors of personality and interests were moderately related (r = .32), but stronger correlated changes were found among specific personality–interest pairs that share situational content. Overall, results reveal how interests and personality are related across different types of continuity and change. While there was little correspondence between group-level changes, substantial correlated change occurred at the individual level. This means that when a person’s personality changes, their interests tend to change in predictable ways (and vice versa). Integrative theories that link different aspects of psychological functioning can benefit by incorporating these findings.},

Methods: We studied 875 older adults (ages 71–82, 47\% black) without prevalent dementia from the Health, Aging and Body Composition study, who completed the NEO Five-Factor Inventory for Conscientiousness and Openness to Experience. Incident dementia over 8 years (mean = 6.9 years) was determined by hospital records, medications, or ≥1.5 SD race-specific decline on the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination. In adjusted models, we investigated associations between each trait and risk of dementia, including for race interactions. Results: Associations between personality traits and dementia risk did not differ by race (interactions: p {\textgreater} 0.7). Higher Conscientiousness was associated with lower dementia risk (adjusted HR per 1SD = 0.78; 95\% CI 0.65–0.94). There was no association for Openness to Experience (adjusted HR per 1SD = 0.88; 95\% CI 0.71–1.08). Conclusions: Higher Conscientiousness is associated with lower dementia risk, even among diverse populations.

	abstract = {Contemporary models emphasize linkages between malleable positive psychological orientations and enhanced quality of life. As such, it is important to consider if these positive orientations provide unique explanatory power beyond the long-established relations between quality of life and within-person, less malleable personality traits. This study contributed to the literature by examining the relations among adolescents’ personality traits, positive psychology orientations, and self-reported quality of life indicators. These relations were further examined by considering the mediating effects of the important contextual influences of school connectedness. Self-report responses of 1867 California high school students to an 88-item schoolwide online survey that included the Big Five Inventory-10 (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness), the Social Emotional Health Survey-Secondary (Belief in Self, Belief in Others, Emotional Competence, and Engaged Living), the School Connectedness Scale, the Brief Multidimensional Life Satisfaction Scale, and the Social Emotional Distress Scale-Secondary were used to examine relations. Stepwise multiple regression analyses showed that after controlling for demographic variables (Block 1: sex, grade, and ethnicity) the personality traits (Block 2) were, as expected, significantly associated with life satisfaction and emotional distress. Supporting study hypotheses, the inclusion of positive psychological orientations (Block 3) explained significantly more variance of students’ life satisfaction (△R2 = 26\%) and emotional distress (△R2 = 5\%). Mediation analyses using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) found that only positive psychological orientations had significant indirect relations with quality of life through school connectedness. Implications and future research and practice are discussed.},

The main goal of the present study was to investigate the relationships between the Big Five personality traits, negative life events, and life satisfaction in adolescents. In addition, the moderating roles of personality traits in the relationship between negative life events and life satisfaction were examined. The sample consisted of 500 Serbian adolescents, aged 16 to 18 (M age = 17.37; 67.7\% females). The results showed that negative life events, extraversion, and agreeableness had unique contributions to predicting life satisfaction. The moderation analysis demonstrated that personality traits did not moderate the relationship between negative life events and life satisfaction. The results of the present study indicate that the association between negative life events and adolescent life satisfaction is independent of personality traits, and support the conclusion that the relative contribution of personality traits to life satisfaction among adolescents is culture-specific.},

In an online participant panel (N = 1055), neuroticism was associated with one factor of vigilance: sensation awareness belief. This factor had a suppression effect on the relationship between neuroticism and healthy behavior, such that the effect of neuroticism through vigilance was healthy, whereas the direct effect was unhealthy.

	abstract = {Young people are increasingly turning to social media for health-related information in areas such as physical activity, diet/nutrition and body image. Yet, there are few robust empirical accounts of the content and form of the health-related material young people access and attend to, or the health-related content they create and share. Furthermore, there is little guidance from research or policy on young people's engagement with health-related social media. This leaves many relevant adults ill-equipped to protect young people from the negative influences of social media and to optimize the potential of social media as a medium for health promotion. This article presents new evidence on young people's engagement with social media and the influences they report on their health-related behaviors. The research was undertaken with 1296 young people (age 13–18) using a participatory mixed methods design. Initially, a public pedagogy [Giroux, 2004. Public pedagogy and the politics of neo-liberalism: Making the political more pedagogical. Policy Futures in Education, 2, 494–503] theoretical framework was used to guide data analysis but this was found to be limiting. An adapted framework was developed, therefore, drawing on Miller et al. [2016. How the world changed social media. London: UCL Press] and Lomborg [2011. Social media as communicative genres. Journal of Media and Communication Research, 51, 55–71] to account for the unique ways in which pedagogy operates in a social media context. Young people accessed and used a range of health-related information on body transformations, diet/nutritional supplements or recipes and workouts/exercises, albeit in different ways. Moreover, young people identified five forms of content that influenced their understandings and behaviours: (i) automatically sourced content; (ii) suggested or recommended content; (iii) peer content; (iv) likes; (v) reputable content. The findings also suggest that relevant adults can reduce risk and realize more of the positive impacts of social media for young people by focusing on content, and the ways in which content is shaped in the interplay between interactive functionalities of social media (e.g. likes and followers) and young people's social uses of social media (e.g. friends, information).},

Using data from a 3-wave longitudinal experience sampling study, we examined the within-person fluctuations in the level of emotion differentiation across days and months and tested if these fluctuations related to changes in stress levels. On the day-level, we found that differentiation of negative emotions varied significantly within individuals, that high stress levels were associated with lower levels of emotion differentiation, and that stress on 1 day negatively predicted the level of differentiation of negative emotions on a next day (but not vice versa). On the wave-level, we found a concurrent, but not a prospective relationship between stress and emotion differentiation. These results are the first to directly demonstrate the role of stress in predicting fluctuations in emotion differentiation and have implications for our theoretical understanding of emotion differentiation, as well as for interventions.},

A similar acceleration in cognitive decline occurs in the years before death as well. To evaluate preclinical and terminal cognitive decline, past researchers have incorporated change points in their analyses of longitudinal data, identifying point estimates of how many years prior to diagnosis or death that decline begins to accelerate. The current systematic review aimed to summarize the published literature on preclinical and terminal change points in relation to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia, and death, identifying the order in which cognitive and neurological outcomes decline and factors that modify the onset and rate of decline. A systematic search protocol yielded 35 studies, describing 16 longitudinal cohorts, modeling change points for cognitive and neurological outcomes preceding MCI, dementia, or death. Change points for cognitive abilities ranged from 3–7 years prior to MCI diagnosis, 1–11 years prior to dementia diagnosis, and 3–15 years before death. No sequence of decline was observed preceding MCI or death, but the following sequence was tentatively accepted for Alzheimer’s disease: verbal memory, visuospatial ability, executive functions and fluency, and last, verbal IQ. Some of the modifiers of the onset and rate of decline examined by previous researchers included gender, education, genetics, neuropathology, and personality. Change point analyses evidence accelerated decline preceding MCI, dementia, and death, but moderators of the onset and rate of decline remain ambiguous due to between-study modeling differences, and coordinated analyses may improve comparability across future studies.},

However, little research has assessed the stability of temperament from early childhood to early adolescence. Moreover, few studies have examined the influence of measurement and analytic methods on the stability of early temperament over periods of more than a few years. We obtained laboratory observations and mother and father reports of temperamental negative and positive emotionality and effortful control from 559 three‐year‐olds. Approximately nine years later, children and both parents completed questionnaire measures of similar temperament constructs. Zero‐order correlations revealed greater within‐informant than cross‐informant stability. In addition, compared with parent reports, early childhood laboratory measures showed greater convergent and divergent validity with child, mother, and father reports at age 12. Finally, latent temperament variables at age 3 composed of laboratory and parent‐report measures and latent variables at age 12 composed of parent and child reports showed moderate stability. There was also a weak but significant association of early effortful control with later negative and positive emotionality. Results have implications for assessing temperament and knowledge of the stability of temperament across childhood. Copyright © 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology},

In-depth interviews with a sub-sample of youth (n = 26), selected for maximum variation, reveal that affect experiences can be organized across four functional dimensions. Relational interactions contribute to both closeness and disconnection; self-expression facilitates affirmation alongside concern about others’ judgments; interest-driven exploration confers inspiration and distress; and browsing leads to entertainment and boredom, as well as admiration and envy. All interviewees describe positive and negative affect experiences across multiple dimensions. Analyses suggest the relationship between social technology usage and well-being—whether enhanced or degraded—is not confined to an “either/or” framework: the emotional see-saw of social media use is weighted by both positive and negative influences.},

Method: A sample of 46 men and women from the Midlife in the United States II (MIDUS II) study completed the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) and provided 4 salivary cortisol samples per day over 4 consecutive days. Trait reappraisal and suppression were tested as predictors of 3 cortisol parameters averaged across days: cortisol awakening response (CAR), diurnal cortisol slope (DCS), and area under the curve with respect to ground (AUCg). Results: Higher scores on the suppression scale were associated with more physiological activation, as indicated by steeper CAR and flatter DCS. Suppression was not associated with AUCg, and reappraisal was not predictive of any cortisol parameter. Conclusions: Individual differences in suppression, but not reappraisal, were linked to greater cortisol activation in this naturalistic study. These preliminary results add to a growing body of findings that link suppression to adverse psychological and physiological profiles.},

	abstract = {Objectives: There is a consensus that social connectedness is integral for a long, healthy life. However, studies of social support and survival have primarily relied on baseline social support measures, potentially missing the effects of fluctuations of perceived support over time. This is especially important for older adults who experience increased changes in disability. This study examined whether among older adults time-varying perceived social support was associated with time to death (main effect model of support) and whether time-varying disability was a modifier (stress-buffering model of support). Gender and marital status were also examined as modifiers. Methods: Older adults in the Cardiovascular Health Study (N = 5,201) completed self- report measures of demographics and psychological health and clinical risk factors for mortality at baseline (1989–1990). Perceived social support and disability were measured from baseline through Wave 11 (1998–1999). Cox regression of time to death with time-varying covariates was performed. Results: Time-varying as well as baseline-only perceived social support was associated with greater survival in the unadjusted models but not after adjustment. Gender, marital status, and time-varying disability were not significant modifiers. Conclusions: In contrast with the previously reported association between baseline individual differences in perceived social support and time to death, older adults’ baseline-only and fluctuating perceptions of perceived support over time were not associated with time to death after adjustment for other clinical physical and psychological risk factors. Research is needed to identify other relationship factors that may be more informative as time-varying predictors of health and longevity in large longitudinal data sets.},

We briefly review the various terms and uses of ILMs in various fields of psychology and present five main strategies that can help researchers infer causality in ILM studies. We discuss the use of temporal precedence to establish causality, through both lagged analyses and natural experiments; the use of external measures and peer reports to go beyond self‐report data; delving deeper into repeated measures to derive new indices; the use of contextual factors occurring during the measurement period; and combining experimental methods and ILMs. These strategies are illustrated by examples from existing research and by new empirical findings from two dyadic daily diary studies (N = 80 and N = 108 couples) and an experience sampling method study of personality states (N = 52). We conclude by offering a short checklist for designing ILM studies with causality in mind and look at the applicability of these strategies in the intersection of personality psychology and other psychological research domains.

It includes four subscales: Esteem/Emotional Support, Social Companionship, Informational Support, and Instrumental Support. In college and community samples, factor analytic and item response theory results suggest that subtypes of in-person social support also pertain in the online world. Evidence of reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity provide excellent psychometric support for the measure. Construct validity accrues to the measure vis-à-vis support for three hypotheses: (a) Various broad types of Internet platforms for social interactions are differentially associated with online social support and online victimization; (b) similar to in-person social support, online social support offsets the adverse effect of negative life events on self-esteem and depression-related outcome; and (c) online social support counteracts the effects of online victimization in much the same way that in-person friends in one social niche counterbalance rejection in other social niches. This study introduces a new self-report questionnaire to measure four broad types of online social support, similar to those found for in-person social support: esteem/emotional support, social companionship, informational support, and instrumental support. Different online sites and apps provide opportunities for different types and amounts of social support. Similar to in-person social support, online social support helps people cope with adversity.},

Individual variable as well as combined predictive models of social role impairment were examined. Results: Higher neuroticism (β = 0.30, p {\textless} .05), lower agreeableness (β = −0.35 p {\textless} .001) and higher IIP-PD-15 (β = 0.28, p {\textless} .01) scores predicted greater impairment in social role functioning. A combined predictive model of neuroticism and IIP-PD-15 scores predicted unique variance in social role impairment (R2 = .71). Conclusion: These results link select personality traits and interpersonal processes to social role impairment, suggesting that these are indicators of personality pathology in older adults. Clinical Implications: These findings lend preliminary support for clinical screening of personality pathology in depressed older adults utilizing both personality trait and process measures.},

However, detailed studies have yet to analyze the relationship between PIU and the Five-Factor Model (FFM) while considering (1) the domains and specific facets of the FFM and (2) the components of PIU. This study analyzes data collected from 910 adolescents who were administered the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) and the JS-NEO-S questionnaire to measure the domains and facets of the FFM. The results show that high levels of Neuroticism and Extraversion and low levels of Agreeableness, Openness, and Conscientiousness predict PIU. This study allows for the determination of the specific facets of the Big Five that are associated with an increased risk of PIU. Furthermore, it suggests that different traits are associated with each of the PIU components: low Agreeableness predict Emotional Investment in Internet use, while high Neuroticism, high Extraversion, and low Conscientiousness predict a decrease in Performance and Time Management. Therefore, these results suggest that distinct personal mechanisms may be involved in the different dimensions making up PIU.},

	abstract = {Self‐control is associated with a variety of positive life outcomes, including relationship satisfaction, health, educational achievement, and avoiding criminal behaviour. A largely unanswered question concerns the extent to which self‐control changes across the lifespan and in response to major life events. The present research used prospective four‐wave data from 539 Dutch individuals to examine the self‐control trajectory of first‐time parents (n = 246) as compared with individuals who did not have children during the research period (n = 293). New parents (especially mothers) reported higher levels of self‐control before birth (i.e. during pregnancy) than did nonparents. New mothers showed significant non‐linear decreases in self‐control, which were especially strong from pregnancy until 6 months after childbirth. New fathers' self‐control remained largely stable. Furthermore, pregnancy‐related stress was associated with lower self‐control levels during pregnancy in both first‐time mothers and fathers. Higher levels of work–family conflict and family‐related stress were associated with lower self‐control after childbirth in new fathers, but not in new mothers. These results indicate that major life transitions may be linked to changes in adult self‐control. Discussion focuses on the implications of the results for theory and research on the development of self‐control in adulthood. © 2018 The Authors.

	abstract = {Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are among the most challenging aspects of Alzheimer disease for patients and their families. Previous studies have found associations between informant-reported retrospective personality and BPSD; we test whether prospective, self-reported personality predicts who will experience these symptoms. Deceased participants from the Health and Retirement Study who had evidence of cognitive impairment at the end of life (N = 1988) were selected to examine whether self-reported five-factor model personality traits, measured up to 8 years before death, were associated with proxy-reported BPSD. Neuroticism was associated with increased risk of the 7 BPSD: got lost in familiar places, wandered off, were not able to be left alone, experienced hallucinations, suffered from depression, had periodic confusion, and an uncontrolled temper. These associations were not moderated by age, gender, race, or education. Conscientiousness was associated with fewer symptoms overall and especially with lower risk of getting lost in familiar places and not being able to be left alone. The present research indicates that self-reported personality, particularly Neuroticism, is associated prospectively with risk for a wide range of behavioral symptoms for individuals who had cognitive impairment at the end of life. The use of self-reported personality traits can help aid in identifying who is most at risk for behavioral symptoms. Such information may be useful for nonpharmacological interventions tailored to the individual's personality to reduce the prevalence and burden of these BPSD.},

In addition, the current study tests longitudinal associations between Big Five domains and facets and 3 aspects of adjustment: self-esteem, academic adjustment, and social adjustment in college. Specifically, the study examines codevelopment (correlated change), personality effects on later changes in adjustment, and adjustment effects on later changes in personality. Two large longitudinal samples from different countries were employed. Results suggested that rank-order stabilities of facets were generally large (i.e., {\textgreater}.50) across samples, and comparable with those observed for trait domains. Mean-level findings were largely in line with the maturity principle: levels of neuroticism and (most of) its facets decreased, whereas levels of the other domains and facets were either stable or increased. However, patterns sometimes slightly differed between facets of the same trait domain. All 3 types of longitudinal associations between personality and adjustment were found, but unlike mean-level change often varied by facet. The Extraversion facet of positive affect and the Conscientiousness facets of goal-striving and dependability were positively associated with all 3 adjustment indicators in both samples, whereas the Neuroticism facets of depression and self-reproach were consistently negatively associated with adjustment. In sum, our findings demonstrate that considering Big Five trait facets may be useful to reveal the nuanced ways in which personality develops in tandem with adjustment in college.},

Furthermore, heeding the call to use more sophisticated psychometric modeling of the conscientiousness spectrum, we used different types of scale construction and scoring methods (i.e., dominance and ideal point) and again found no evidence of curvilinear relationships between conscientiousness and the aforementioned variables.

Longitudinal observational cohort study. Academic medical center. Members of an apolipoprotein E (APOE) ɛ4 genetically enriched cohort of Maricopa County residents who were neuropsychiatrically healthy at entry (N = 277). Over a mean interval of 7 years, 25 who developed MCI and had the Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Openness Personality Inventory—Revised (NEO‐PI‐R) before and during the MCI transition epoch were compared with 252 nontransitioners also with serial NEO‐PI‐R administrations. Longitudinal administration of the NEO‐PI‐R and neuropsychological test battery. Change in NEO‐PI‐R factor scores (neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness) from entry to the epoch of MCI diagnosis or an equivalent follow‐up duration in nontransitioners. NEO‐PI‐R neuroticism T‐scores increased significantly more in MCI transitioners than in nontransitioners (mean 2.9, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.9–4.9 vs 0, 95\% CI = −0.7–0.7, P = .02), and openness decreased more in MCI transitioners than in nontransitioners (−4.8, 95\% CI = −7.3 to −2.4 vs −1.0, 95\% CI = −1.6 to −0.4, P {\textless} .001). Concurrent subclinical but statistically significant changes in behavioral scores worsened more in MCI transitioners than nontransitioners for measures of depression, somatization, irritability, anxiety, and aggressive attitude.

Personality and sleep quality were assessed at baseline and again 4 to 10 years later. Results: Scoring lower on neuroticism and higher on extraversion was associated with better sleep quality at baseline and over time, with effect sizes larger than those of demographic factors. Low conscientiousness was associated with a worsening of sleep quality over time. Openness and agreeableness were unrelated to sleep quality. Poor sleep quality at baseline was associated with steeper declines in extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness and a smaller decrease in neuroticism over time. Conclusion: Replicable findings across samples support longitudinal associations between personality and sleep quality. This study identified specific personality traits that are associated with poor and worsening sleep quality, and substantiated previous findings that poor sleep quality is associated with detrimental personality trajectories.},

Perceived diabetes-specific peer support and adherence were assessed in each survey. Glycemic control was measured with HbA1c assay kits. Results: Perceived diabetes-specific peer support in high school predicted better adherence across the subsequent year while controlling for initial levels of adherence. Perceived peer support during early emerging adulthood was also associated with better adherence across time, after controlling for initial levels of both adherence and peer support. Conclusions: Perceived diabetes-specific peer support may be a protective factor as late adolescents with type 1 diabetes transition out of high school. Building strong peer support during the transition into early emerging adulthood may facilitate better diabetes management during this high-risk time of development.},

Researchers have documented the detrimental effects of initial emotional reactivity to daily stressors on future physical health outcomes but have yet to examine the effects of emotions that linger after a stressor occurs. The current study investigated how negative affect that lingers the day after a minor stressor occurs is associated with health-related outcomes. Participants (N = 1,155) in a community-based, nationwide study answered questions about daily stressors and affect across 8 consecutive days and about their physical health almost 10 years later. Multilevel models indicated that people experience heightened levels of negative affect the day after a stressor occurs. Furthermore, higher levels of lingering negative affect are associated with greater numbers of chronic conditions and worse functional limitations 10 years later. Findings suggest that affective recovery from daily stressors has unique importance for long-term physical health.},

We examined whether naturally occurring, within‐individual variation in personality traits over time is associated with corresponding changes in smoking, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and body mass index. Data were from seven longitudinal cohort studies with a total sample of 56 786 participants with two or three repeated measurements of the Five Factor Model personality traits assessed over 4 to 19 years. Repeated measurements were used to tease apart between‐individual and within‐individual associations. In the within‐individual analysis, all the personality traits were associated with physical activity, and extraversion was associated with risky alcohol consumption. There were no other within‐individual associations. In the between‐individual analysis, lower conscientiousness, emotional stability, agreeableness, and openness to experience, and higher extraversion, were associated with many risky health behaviours. Our findings suggest that health behaviours are related mostly to stable, between‐individual differences in personality traits, but changes in adult personality may have only limited association with changes in health behaviours. © 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology},

As part of a longitudinal, clinical-neuropsychological-genetic survey on SCD and MCI, 284 patients referred to our hospital between 1990 and 2017 were included. All patients underwent clinical-extensive neuropsychological evaluation and Apolipoprotein E genotyping; personality traits were assessed in a subgroup. Each patient underwent clinical-neuropsychological follow-up. Subjects with a follow-up shorter than two years were excluded. A total of 212 subjects were, after exclusions, considered: 26 out of 109 SCD subjects progressed to MCI (SCD-p), 15 converted to AD (SCD-c), and 68 remained stable (SCD-s). Of 103 MCI subjects, 39 converted to AD (MCI-c) and 64 remained stable (MCI-s). At baseline, SCD-c performed significantly worse than SCD-s in tests assessing long-term verbal memory. MCI-c showed worse performance on neuropsychological tests for short- and long-term verbal memory and for ecological evaluation of memory (RBMT). These tests provided good accuracy in distinguishing MCI-c and MCI-s. Emotional stability was significantly lower in SCD-s than in SCD-p while higher intellectual activities were associated with a lower risk of conversion to MCI. Our results suggest that memory neuropsychological tests may represent a reliable tool to estimate the risk of progression to AD. Personality and lifestyle factors could provide useful information to identify SCD subjects who may develop an objective cognitive impairment.},

	abstract = {Potential diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) can be a common concern for middle-aged and older adults. Kessler, Bowen, Baer, Froelich, and Wahl (2012) termed this specific type of anxiety “dementia worry (DW),” which involves distressing concern about developing dementia, even in the absence of cognitive impairment. DW can thus develop in individuals of all ages and cognitive status. This study examined whether personality traits are associated with DW. Participants were recruited from two online sources and consisted of 127 middle-aged and older adults (aged 40 – 81 years, M = 52.54, SD = 9.33). Participants completed a 20-item assessment of Big Five Personality traits (Donnellan, Oswald, Baird, \& Lucas, 2006) and the 12-item Dementia Worry Scale (Kinzer \& Suhr, 2016). Correlation analyses revealed that age was not associated with DW, p = .14. DW was negatively correlated with conscientiousness (r = -.21, p =.02), positively correlated with neuroticism (r = .32, p {\textless} .01), and unrelated to extroversion, agreeableness, and openness (ps {\textgreater} .07). Older age was associated with lower levels of neuroticism (r = -.18, p = .04) and unrelated to other personality variables. These findings expand our understanding of how personality relates to levels of concern middle-aged and older adults report about dementia. Based on the study design, causal order cannot be determined; however, given the likelihood that personality develops prior to concerns about dementia, results suggest that individual differences in personality are likely to influence level of DW.},

Stability was low in the dementia group (rtt = 0.43), and this was not simply due to lower reliability given that internal consistency remained adequate in the dementia group.

While the first generation of epigenetic biomarkers of aging were developed using chronological age as a surrogate for biological age, we hypothesized that incorporation of composite clinical measures of phenotypic age that capture differences in lifespan and healthspan may identify novel CpGs and facilitate the development of a more powerful epigenetic biomarker of aging. Using an innovative two-step process, we develop a new epigenetic biomarker of aging, DNAm PhenoAge, that strongly outperforms previous measures in regards to predictions for a variety of aging outcomes, including all-cause mortality, cancers, healthspan, physical functioning, and Alzheimer's disease. While this biomarker was developed using data from whole blood, it correlates strongly with age in every tissue and cell tested. Based on an in-depth transcriptional analysis in sorted cells, we find that increased epigenetic, relative to chronological age, is associated with increased activation of pro-inflammatory and interferon pathways, and decreased activation of transcriptional/translational machinery, DNA damage response, and mitochondrial signatures. Overall, this single epigenetic biomarker of aging is able to capture risks for an array of diverse outcomes across multiple tissues and cells, and provide insight into important pathways in aging.},

Using data from two diverse longitudinal samples (N = 1,919) collected at two time points an average of 10 years apart, we showed that significant weight gain is associated with increases in both impulsiveness and deliberation: In both samples, middle-aged adults who gained 10\% or more of their baseline body weight by follow-up increased in their tendency to give in to temptation, yet were more thoughtful about the consequences of their actions. The present research moves beyond life events to implicate health status in adult personality development. The findings also suggest that interventions focusing on the emotional component of impulse control may be more effective because even people who become more thoughtful about the consequences of their actions may have limited success at inhibiting their behavior.},

	abstract = {Regional differences in the clinical care of Type 1 diabetes (T1D) in Brazil have been recently described. This study aimed to estimate the costs of T1D from the public health care system’s perspective across the regions of Brazil and to determine the components that influence these costs. This was a retrospective, cross-sectional and nationwide multicenter study conducted between December 2008 and December 2010 in 28 public clinics in 20 Brazilian cities. The study included 3,180 T1D subjects receiving healthcare from the National Brazilian Healthcare System (NBHCS) with a follow-up of at least one year. The direct medical costs were derived from the costs of medications, supplies, examinations, visits to the center, medical procedures and hospitalizations that occurred during the previous year. Clinical and demographic factors that determined the differences in the cost across four geographic regions (southeast, south, north/northeast and mid-west) were investigated. The per capita mean annual direct medical costs of T1D in US\$ were 1,466.36, 1,252.83, 1,148.09 and 1,396.30 in southeast, south, north/northeast and mid-west regions, respectively. The costs of T1D in the southeast region were higher compared to south (p {\textless} 0.001) and north/northeast regions (p = {\textless} 0.001), but not to the mid-west (p = 0.146) region. The frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) was different across the regions as well as the daily number of SMBG, use of insulin pumps or basal or prandial insulin analogs. Age, ethnicity, duration of diabetes, level of care, socioeconomic status and the prevalence of chronic diabetic complications differed among the regions. In a regression model the determinants of the costs were the presence of microvascular diabetes-related complications (p {\textless} 0.001), higher economic status (p {\textless} 0.001), and being from the southeast region (p {\textless} 0.001). The present data reinforce the regional differences in the costs of T1D and in the socioeconomic profile and health care provided to the patients with T1D in specialized public centers in Brazil. Both factors influenced directly the costs of T1D and should be considered for discussing future health policies.},

In addition, we review the extant literature, suggesting that goal disengagement capacities can reduce psychological distress and ameliorate patterns of biological dysregulation and physical health problems if individuals experience unattainable goals. Goal reengagement capacities, by contrast, are shown to be associated with positive indicators of subjective well-being (e.g., positive affect or purpose in life) but rarely predict psychological distress or physical health outcomes.

This article aimed to systematically review case–control and prospective studies on the association between personality and risk of these cognitive disorders.MethodsStudies were identified through Scopus, Medline, PubMed, and PsycINFO. Searches combined terms for personality with those for dementia and MCI. Data were extracted and checked by a second reviewer, systematically reviewed, and meta-analyzed where appropriate.ResultsTwelve longitudinal and three case–control studies were included. Five of nine studies found that higher neuroticism was associated with greater dementia risk (pooled hazard ratio [HR] per unit increase on neuroticism score, HR = 1.13, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.08–1.18, z = 5.11, p {\textless}0.001, N = 3,285), and two studies showed it increased risk of MCI.

Three of four studies found no association between openness and dementia; however, pooled data suggested openness was protective (HR = 0.88, 95\% CI = 0.81–0.97, z = 2.34, p = 0.008, N = 1,687). Seven studies indicated that extraversion was not linked with dementia, and four found no association between agreeableness and dementia.ConclusionsNeuroticism increased risk for dementia, and conscientiousness reduced risk. The protective effect of openness was tentative. Extraversion and agreeableness were not associated with dementia. Personality should be incorporated in conceptual models of dementia risk.

To identify, appraise, and synthesize research evidence on the relationships between health literacy (functional, interactive, and critical) or numeracy and health outcomes (i.e., knowledge, behavioral and clinical) in people with diabetes. English-language articles that addressed the relationship between health literacy or numeracy and at least one health outcome in people with diabetes were identified by two reviewers through searching six scientific databases, and hand-searching journals and reference lists. Seven hundred twenty-three citations were identified and screened, 196 were considered, and 34 publications reporting data from 24 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Consistent and sufficient evidence showed a positive association between health literacy and diabetes knowledge (eight studies). There was a lack of consistent evidence on the relationship between health literacy or numeracy and clinical outcomes, e.g., A1C (13 studies), self-reported complications (two studies), and achievement of clinical goals (one study); behavioral outcomes, e.g., self-monitoring of blood glucose (one study), self-efficacy (five studies); or patient-provider interactions (i.e., patient-physician communication, information exchange, decision-making, and trust), and other outcomes. The majority of the studies were from US primary care setting (87.5 \%), and there were no randomized or other trials to improve health literacy. Low health literacy is consistently associated with poorer diabetes knowledge. However, there is little sufficient or consistent evidence suggesting that it is independently associated with processes or outcomes of diabetes-related care. Based on these findings, it may be premature to routinely screen for low health literacy as a means for improving diabetes-related health-related outcomes.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE This study updates previous estimates of the economic burden of diagnosed diabetes and quantifies the increased health resource use and lost productivity associated with diabetes in 2012.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The study uses a prevalence-based approach that combines the demographics of the U.S. population in 2012 with diabetes prevalence, epidemiological data, health care cost, and economic data into a Cost of Diabetes Model. Health resource use and associated medical costs are analyzed by age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance coverage, medical condition, and health service category. Data sources include national surveys, Medicare standard analytical files, and one of the largest claims databases for the commercially insured population in the U.S.RESULTS The total estimated cost of diagnosed diabetes in 2012 is \$245 billion, including \$176 billion in direct medical costs and \$69 billion in reduced productivity. The largest components of medical expenditures are hospital inpatient care (43\% of the total medical cost), prescription medications to treat the complications of diabetes (18\%), antidiabetic agents and diabetes supplies (12\%), physician office visits (9\%), and nursing/residential facility stays (8\%). People with diagnosed diabetes incur average medical expenditures of about \$13,700 per year, of which about \$7,900 is attributed to diabetes. People with diagnosed diabetes, on average, have medical expenditures approximately 2.3 times higher than what expenditures would be in the absence of diabetes. For the cost categories analyzed, care for people with diagnosed diabetes accounts for more than 1 in 5 health care dollars in the U.S., and more than half of that expenditure is directly attributable to diabetes. Indirect costs include increased absenteeism (\$5 billion) and reduced productivity while at work (\$20.8 billion) for the employed population, reduced productivity for those not in the labor force (\$2.7 billion), inability to work as a result of disease-related disability (\$21.6 billion), and lost productive capacity due to early mortality (\$18.5 billion).CONCLUSIONS The estimated total economic cost of diagnosed diabetes in 2012 is \$245 billion, a 41\% increase from our previous estimate of \$174 billion (in 2007 dollars). This estimate highlights the substantial burden that diabetes imposes on society. Additional components of societal burden omitted from our study include intangibles from pain and suffering, resources from care provided by nonpaid caregivers, and the burden associated with undiagnosed diabetes.},

Youth with Type 1 diabetes (n = 118) were enrolled in a prospective study that examined the transition from the paediatric to adult healthcare systems and were evaluated during their senior year of high school (time 1) and 1 year later (time 2). Data on self care, glycaemic control and parent relationship were collected. The majority of youth saw a paediatric endocrinologist at both assessments (n = 64); others saw an adult care physician at both assessments (n = 26) or transitioned from a paediatric endocrinologist to an adult care physician (n = 19). Nine youth saw no physician between time 1 and time 2. There were group differences in demographic and parent relationship variables and self-care behaviour and glycaemic control related to the transition of care. Youth who remained in the paediatric healthcare system had the best self care and did not experience declines in glycaemic control over time. Early transition from the paediatric healthcare system to the adult healthcare system is associated with psychosocial variables and worse glycaemic control. Future research should identify factors that determine optimal timing and strategies to avoid deterioration of care and control during this transition.},

The purpose of this study was to understand information-seeking behaviours, Internet use and social networking online in adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). This applied to their everyday life, including the context of diabetes and their experiences and need of contact with T1DM peers. Twenty-four adolescents aged 10–17 years with T1DM were recruited from a county hospital in the south-east of Sweden. Qualitative data were obtained using eight focus groups, wherein each participant engaged in a 60–90 minute video/audio-recorded session. The focus group data were transcribed and analysed using qualitative content analysis. Some demographic and medical information was also collected. The three main categories that were identified; Aspects of Security, Updating, and Plainness and their sub-categories gave significant information about how to enhance information retrieval and peer contacts related to T1DM. Regarding the persons' information-seeking behaviour, Internet use, and use of social media some differences could be identified depending on gender and age. Sensitivity and adaptation to users' needs and expectations seem crucial in the development of future online resources for adolescents with T1DM. To start with, this could mean applying a wider range of already existing information and communication technologies. Health practitioners need to focus on the areas of security of information and communication, frequency of updating, and simplicity of design-less is more.},

	abstract = {Objective: The goal of this article is to provide insight into how recent findings from affective science may be translated into the health arena. Methods: We first review definitional issues related to the key concepts of emotion and stress. We then review relevant research that informs our understanding of the affect–health relationship. Subsequently, we highlight findings that are the most informative and also ripe for translation into the domains of health and health-related behaviors. Results: We identify several domains of affect-relevant processes (e.g., emotion-regulation, stress response) that would benefit from increased elaboration. Three themes may guide how best to broaden our understanding across multiple domains: the need to use a differentiated emotion-based approach, the need to consider potential synergistic and oppositional effects of emotion that can occur in parallel, and the need to examine the impact of emotions with respect to regulation and coping at both the intra- and interindividual levels. Building on insights derived from these themes, we suggest a broad integrative framework for use with future investigations. This framework categorizes potential emotion-related effects on health according to whether they influence health directly (e.g., shaping physiological responses) or indirectly (e.g., guiding decision making and behavior). Using this approach will allow researchers to examine systematically the often simultaneous and sometimes opposing influences of emotion on distinct health-relevant cognitive and physiological mechanisms, and to integrate across potentially disparate findings. Conclusions: We conclude by suggesting opportunities for future work that we see as most fruitful based on the presented framework.},

	abstract = {Mortality-related processes are known to modulate late-life change in cognitive abilities, but it is an open question whether and how precipitous declines with impending death generalize to other domains of functioning. We investigated this notion by using 13-year longitudinal data from now-deceased participants in the Berlin Aging Study (N = 439; 70–103 years at first occasion; M = 87 years). Using time metrics of chronological age and time-to-death, we compared changes in key indicators of cognitive, sensory, physical, health, social, and self-related domains. Across variables and domains, mortality models revealed steeper average rates of change than age models. However, some domain indicators were more prone to mortality-related change than others. Examining between-person differences, we found that sociodemographic characteristics (surviving to an older age at death, being a woman, lower socioeconomic status) and proxies of pathologies (comorbidities, disability, and suspected dementia) related to lower levels of late-life functioning. In contrast, little evidence was found for correlates of differential change. Our results illustrate both the pervasive nature of progressive processes leading toward death and their domain specificity. Inquiries with more closely spaced multidomain measurements are needed to identify invariant and variable aspects of the end-of-life “cascade.”},

This study examined how adolescents with type 1 diabetes, their parents and physicians perceive 4 key diabetes self-care behaviours (testing blood glucose, taking insulin, exercise and diet) and what influences those behaviours.MethodForty-eight adolescent/parent dyads and 21 pediatric endocrinologists rated importance, difficulty and proficiency for 4 self-care behaviours, and provided up to 5 perceived influences on these behaviours. We compared adolescents to parents and families to physicians.ResultsGroups rated all self-care behaviours as important, with taking insulin as most important. Families rated behaviours as relatively easy compared to physicians. All groups agreed that diet was both the most difficult self-care behaviour and the behaviour at which adolescents were least proficient. Although families rated teens as proficient overall, physicians disagreed. Adolescent and parent perception of diet difficulty was related to poorer glycemic control, and blood glucose testing and insulin administration proficiency were linked to better glycemic control. Compared to other groups, teens were especially likely to mention internal and hindering influences, and more likely to mention other people as negative influences.ConclusionsAlthough all groups agreed that all self-care behaviours are important, there are key areas of discrepancy in perceptions, particularly between families and physicians. Further research should connect the beliefs examined in this study to actual self-care behaviours.},

	abstract = {Objective: Subjective well-being has well-established positive health consequences. During emerging adulthood, from ages 18 to 25 years, people’s global evaluations of their well-being (i.e., satisfaction with life [SWL]) appear to worsen more than any other time in the adult life span, indicating that this population would benefit from strategies to enhance SWL. In these studies, we investigated top-down (i.e., time-invariant, trait-like) and bottom-up (i.e., time-varying, state-like) influences of physical activity (PA) on daily SWL. Methods: Two daily diary studies lasting 8 days (N = 190) and 14 days (N = 63) were conducted with samples of emerging adults enrolled in college to evaluate relations between daily PA and SWL while controlling for established and plausible top-down and bottom-up influences on SWL. Results: In both studies, multilevel models indicated that people reported greater SWL on days when they were more active (a within-person, bottom-up effect). Top-down effects of PA were not significant in either study. These findings were robust when we controlled for competing top-down influences (e.g., sex, personality traits, self-esteem, body mass index, mental health symptoms, fatigue) and bottom-up influences (e.g., daily self-esteem, daily mental health symptoms, daily fatigue). Conclusions: We concluded that SWL was impacted by people’s daily PA rather than their trait level of PA over time. These findings extend evidence that PA is a health behavior with important consequences for daily well-being and should be considered when developing national policies to enhance SWL.},

This paper introduces a model of uncertainty navigation as a novel theoretical framework of the strategies people use to mitigate the anxiety of waiting for health news. The model includes three overarching strategies for uncertainty navigation: consequence mitigation, reappraisal and emotion regulation. It also incorporates several factors that moderate the use of these strategies. Supportive empirical evidence for the use and effectiveness of these strategies is presented, and potential consequences, both good and bad, of using these strategies are described. Finally, some of the many future research directions that arise from this novel theoretical framework are discussed.},

Several reviews of the psychological literature have shown that around 96\% of papers involving the use of null hypothesis significance testing report significant outcomes for their main results but that the typical studies are insufficiently powerful for such a track record. We explain this paradox by showing that the use of several small underpowered samples often represents a more efficient research strategy (in terms of finding p {\textless} .05) than does the use of one larger (more powerful) sample. Publication bias and the most efficient strategy lead to inflated effects and high rates of false positives, especially when researchers also resorted to questionable research practices, such as adding participants after intermediate testing. We provide simulations that highlight the severity of such biases in meta-analyses. We consider 13 meta-analyses covering 281 primary studies in various fields of psychology and find indications of biases and/or an excess of significant results in seven. These results highlight the need for sufficiently powerful replications and changes in journal policies.},

Among hospital discharges in Massachusetts, we find that the reform decreased uninsurance by 36\% relative to its initial level and to other states.

When we control for patient severity, we find evidence that preventable admissions decreased. At the same time, hospital cost growth did not increase.},

Psychosocial factors (stress, personality) are six times as predictive as smoking, cholesterol level or blood pressure and much more responsive to prophylactic treatment. This book admits that, while smoking is a risk factor for cancer and CHD, its effects have been exaggerated.

We used 2001 prevalence and 2002 incidence of T1DM and T2DM from the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study and U.S. Census Bureau population demographic projections. Two scenarios were considered for T1DM and T2DM incidence: 1) constant incidence over time; 2) for T1DM yearly percentage increases of 3.5, 2.2, 1.8, and 2.1\% by age-groups 0–4 years, 5–9 years, 10–14 years, and 15–19 years, respectively, and for T2DM a yearly 2.3\% increase across all ages.

An extensive search revealed that most studies on youth purpose examine psychological correlates and neglect instructional and social supports. School is an effective context for fostering purpose, yet reported approaches for explicitly instructing for purpose are rare after the early 1990s, reflecting a trend away from a language of purpose as a discrete endeavor in education since at least the 1960s. Furthermore, research on the outcomes of early purpose instruction curricula is not present in empirical journal articles. Nevertheless, a concern for fostering youth purpose has not disappeared from education; rather, it is subsumed under approaches that foster more comprehensive positive student outcomes, such as character, civic engagement, and positive youth development. Key curricular approaches to these outcomes are therefore also reviewed and examined for insights into how purpose can be fostered.},

	abstract = {Decision making is an important determinant of health and well-being across the lifespan but is critical in aging, when many influential decisions are made just as cognitive function declines. Increasing evidence suggests that older adults, even those without dementia, often make poor decisions and are selectively vulnerable to scams. To date, however, the factors associated with poor decision making in old age are unknown. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that poor decision making is a consequence of cognitive decline among older persons without Alzheimer’s disease or mild cognitive impairment. Participants were 420 non-demented persons from the Memory and Aging Project, a longitudinal, clinical-pathologic cohort study of aging in the Chicago metropolitan area. All underwent repeated cognitive evaluations and subsequently completed assessments of decision making and susceptibility to scams. Decision making was measured using 12 items from a previously established performance-based measure and a self-report measure of susceptibility to scams. Cognitive function data were collected over an average of 5.5 years prior to the decision making assessment. Regression analyses were used to examine whether the prior rate of cognitive decline predicted the level of decision making and susceptibility to scams; analyses controlled for age, sex, education, and starting level of cognition. Among 420 persons without dementia, more rapid cognitive decline predicted poorer decision making and increased susceptibility to scams (p’s{\textless}0.001). Further, the relations between cognitive decline, decision making and scams persisted in analyses restricted to persons without any cognitive impairment (i.e., no dementia or even mild cognitive impairment). Poor decision making is a consequence of cognitive decline among older persons without Alzheimer’s disease or mild cognitive impairment, those widely considered “cognitively healthy.” These findings suggest that even very subtle age-related changes in cognition have detrimental effects on judgment.},

Five self-reported indicators of adherence were assessed: blood glucose monitoring, insulin administration, diet, exercise, and most recent glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level. CONCLUSIONS: Results revealed a pattern of significant correlations between the Conscientiousness and Neuroticism personality domains and one or more self-reported adherence behaviors. In addition, correlations were also found between one facet of Extraversion and one facet of Agreeableness.

	abstract = {ObjectiveTo examine the personality trait conscientiousness as a risk factor for mortality and to identify candidate explanatory mechanisms.MethodsParticipants in the Whitehall II cohort study (N=6800, aged 34 to 55 at recruitment in 1985) completed two self-reported items measuring conscientiousness in 1991–1993 (‘I am overly conscientious’ and ‘I am overly perfectionistic’, Cronbach's α=.72), the baseline for this study. Age, socio-economic status (SES), social support, health behaviours, physiological variables and minor psychiatric morbidity were also recorded at baseline. The vital status of participants was then monitored for a mean of 17years. All-cause and cause-specific mortality was ascertained through linkage to a national mortality register until January 2010.ResultsEach 1standard deviation decrease in conscientiousness was associated with a 10\% increase in all-cause (hazard ratio [HR]=1.10, 95\% CI 1.003, 1.20) mortality. Patterns were similar for cardiovascular (HR=1.17, 95\% CI 0.98, 1.39) and cancer mortality (HR=1.10, 95\% CI 0.96, 1.25), not reaching statistical significance. The association with all-cause mortality was attenuated by 5\% after adjustment for SES, 13\% for health behaviours, 14\% for cardiovascular risk factors, 5\% for minor psychiatric morbidity, 29\% for all variables. Repeating analyses with each item separately and excluding participants who died within five years of personality assessment did not change the results materially.ConclusionLow conscientiousness in midlife is a risk factor for all-cause mortality. This association is only partly explained by health behaviours, SES, cardiovascular disease risk factors and minor psychiatric morbidity in midlife.},

	abstract = {Objective The association between personality traits and mortality might differ as a function of socioeconomic status (SES). Our aim was to evaluate the all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer mortality risk associated with neuroticism or extraversion and their interactions with SES in a representative sample of the UK adult population. Methods A total of 5450 participants (2505 men) from the Health and Lifestyle Survey completed the Eysenck Personality Inventory at baseline and were monitored for vital status over 25 years. SES was defined as a latent variable comprising occupational social class, educational attainment, and income. Results A significant neuroticism-by-SES-by-sex interaction (p = .04) for CVD mortality revealed a neuroticism-by-SES interaction specific to women. Compared to women with average SES, those with both high neuroticism and low SES were at an increased risk for CVD mortality (hazard ratio = 2.02, 95\&percnt; confidence interval = 1.45–2.80), whereas those with high neuroticism and high SES combined were at a decreased risk for CVD mortality (hazard ratio = 0.61, 95\&percnt; confidence interval = 0.38–0.97, p for interaction = 0.003). The interaction term was not explained by health behaviors (10\&percnt; attenuation) and physiological variables (11\&percnt; attenuation). This interaction was not observed for all-cause and cancer mortality risks or among men for CVD mortality. Conclusions High neuroticism is a risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in women with low SES, whereas in women with higher SES, it is protective. Further research is needed to replicate this finding and identify the mechanisms behind the modifying effect of SES on neuroticism.

Researchers often have to choose between two problematic approaches for analyzing multifaceted constructs: the total score approach and the individual score approach. Both approaches can result in conceptual ambiguity. The proposed bifactor model assesses simultaneously the general construct shared by the facets and the specific facets, over and above the general construct. We illustrate the bifactor model by examining the construct of Extraversion as measured by the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R; Costa \& McCrae, 1992), with two college samples (N = 383 and 378). The analysis reveals that the facets of the NEO-PI-R Extraversion correlate with criteria in opposite directions after partialling out the general construct. The direction of gender differences also varies by facets. Bifactor models combine the advantages but avoid the drawbacks of the 2 existing methods and can lead to greater conceptual clarity.},

	abstract = {Individuals differ not only in their background characteristics but also in how they respond to a particular treatment, intervention, or stimulation. In particular, treatment effects may vary systematically by the propensity for treatment. In this paper, we discuss a practical approach to studying heterogeneous treatment effects as a function of the treatment propensity, under the same assumption commonly underlying regression analysis: ignorability. We describe one parametric method and two nonparametric methods for estimating interactions between treatment and the propensity for treatment. For the first method, we begin by estimating propensity scores for the probability of treatment given a set of observed covariates for each unit and construct balanced propensity score strata; we then estimate propensity score stratum-specific average treatment effects and evaluate a trend across them. For the second method, we match control units to treated units based on the propensity score and transform the data into treatment-control comparisons at the most elementary level at which such comparisons can be constructed; we then estimate treatment effects as a function of the propensity score by fitting a nonparametric model as a smoothing device. For the third method, we first estimate nonparametric regressions of the outcome variable as a function of the propensity score separately for treated units and for control units and then take the difference between the two nonparametric regressions. We illustrate the application of these methods with an empirical example of the effects of college attendance on women’s fertility.},

Like other research, research in health disparities is strongly influenced by the underlying conceptual model of the hypothetical causes of disparities. Conceptual models are important and a major source of debate because multiple types of factors and processes may be involved in generating disparities, because different disciplines emphasize different types of factors, and because the conceptual model often drives what is studied, how results are interpreted, and which interventions are identified as most promising. This article reviews common conceptual approaches to health disparities including the genetic model, the fundamental cause model, the pathways model, and the interaction model.

Multimethod composites were created for personality traits, adversity exposure, and adult outcomes of academic achievement, work, rule-abiding conduct, friendship, and romantic relationships. Regressions showed significant main effects of childhood personality predicting adult outcomes, controlling for adversity, with few interaction effects. In person-focused analyses, the resilient group in EA and YA (high competence, high adversity) showed higher childhood conscientiousness, agreeableness, and openness and lower neuroticism than the maladaptive group (low competence, high adversity). The competent (high competence, low adversity) and resilient groups showed similar childhood traits. Turnaround cases, who changed from the maladaptive group in EA to the resilient group in YA, exhibited higher childhood conscientiousness than persistently maladaptive peers. Findings suggest that children on pathways to success in adulthood, whether facing low or high adversity, have capacities for emotion regulation, empathy and connection, dedication to schoolwork, and mastery and exploration.},

More than half of uninsured US adults did not see a doctor in 2010, and only slightly more than a quarter of these adults were seen by a dentist. We also found that children—many of whom qualify for public coverage through Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program—generally maintained or improved their access to care during the same period. This provides a reason for optimism about the ability of the coverage expansion in the Affordable Care Act to improve access for adults, but it suggests that eliminating the law or curtailing the coverage expansion could result in continued erosion of adults’ access to care.},

We reanalyze Bem's data with a default Bayesian t test and show that the evidence for psi is weak to nonexistent. We argue that in order to convince a skeptical audience of a controversial claim, one needs to conduct strictly confirmatory studies and analyze the results with statistical tests that are conservative rather than liberal. We conclude that Bem's p values do not indicate evidence in favor of precognition; instead, they indicate that experimental psychologists need to change the way they conduct their experiments and analyze their data.},

One hundred forty six community-dwelling older adults participated; 103 had been diagnosed with hypertension. The results showed that older adults who had higher levels of processing capacity or knowledge (domain-general or health) performed better on both of the health literacy measures. Processing capacity interacted with knowledge: Processing capacity had a lower level of association with health literacy for participants with more knowledge than for those with lower levels of knowledge, suggesting that knowledge may offset the effects of processing capacity limitations on health literacy. Furthermore, performance on the two health literacy measures appeared to reflect a different weighting for the three types of abilities. S-TOFHLA performance reflected processing capacity as well as general knowledge, whereas performance on the REALM depended more on general and health knowledge than on processing capacity. The findings support a process-knowledge model of health literacy among older adults, and have implications for selecting health literacy measures in various health care contexts.},

	doi = {10.1186/1748-5908-6-42},
	abstract = {Improving the design and implementation of evidence-based practice depends on successful behaviour change interventions. This requires an appropriate method for characterising interventions and linking them to an analysis of the targeted behaviour. There exists a plethora of frameworks of behaviour change interventions, but it is not clear how well they serve this purpose. This paper evaluates these frameworks, and develops and evaluates a new framework aimed at overcoming their limitations. A systematic search of electronic databases and consultation with behaviour change experts were used to identify frameworks of behaviour change interventions. These were evaluated according to three criteria: comprehensiveness, coherence, and a clear link to an overarching model of behaviour. A new framework was developed to meet these criteria. The reliability with which it could be applied was examined in two domains of behaviour change: tobacco control and obesity. Nineteen frameworks were identified covering nine intervention functions and seven policy categories that could enable those interventions. None of the frameworks reviewed covered the full range of intervention functions or policies, and only a minority met the criteria of coherence or linkage to a model of behaviour. At the centre of a proposed new framework is a 'behaviour system' involving three essential conditions: capability, opportunity, and motivation (what we term the 'COM-B system'). This forms the hub of a 'behaviour change wheel' (BCW) around which are positioned the nine intervention functions aimed at addressing deficits in one or more of these conditions; around this are placed seven categories of policy that could enable those interventions to occur. The BCW was used reliably to characterise interventions within the English Department of Health's 2010 tobacco control strategy and the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence's guidance on reducing obesity. Interventions and policies to change behaviour can be usefully characterised by means of a BCW comprising: a 'behaviour system' at the hub, encircled by intervention functions and then by policy categories. Research is needed to establish how far the BCW can lead to more efficient design of effective interventions.},

Personality traits were assessed with the NEO-Five-Factor Inventory questionnaire. Results: Healthy controls and patients with MCI showed a significant (p {\textless} 0.05) decrease concerning their levels of neuroticism and extraversion over time. MCI subjects scored significantly higher on neuroticism at baseline and lower on openness at all examinations compared to healthy controls. Subjects with higher baseline neuroticism showed a 2.24 times higher risk of developing MCI at the third follow-up (odds ratio = 2.24, 95\% confidence interval = 1.12–4.45 – scores adjusted for education and sex).

	abstract = {Personality traits contribute to health outcomes, in part through their association with major controllable risk factors, such as obesity. Body weight, in turn, reflects our behaviors and lifestyle and contributes to the way we perceive ourselves and others. In this study, the authors use data from a large (N = 1,988) longitudinal study that spanned more than 50 years to examine how personality traits are associated with multiple measures of adiposity and with fluctuations in body mass index (BMI). Using 14,531 anthropometric assessments, the authors modeled the trajectory of BMI across adulthood and tested whether personality predicted its rate of change. Measured concurrently, participants higher on Neuroticism or Extraversion or lower on Conscientiousness had higher BMI; these associations replicated across body fat, waist, and hip circumference. The strongest association was found for the impulsivity facet: Participants who scored in the top 10\% of impulsivity weighed, on average, 11Kg more than those in the bottom 10\%. Longitudinally, high Neuroticism and low Conscientiousness, and the facets of these traits related to difficulty with impulse control, were associated with weight fluctuations, measured as the variability in weight over time. Finally, low Agreeableness and impulsivity-related traits predicted a greater increase in BMI across the adult life span. BMI was mostly unrelated to change in personality traits. Personality traits are defined by cognitive, emotional, and behavioral patterns that likely contribute to unhealthy weight and difficulties with weight management. Such associations may elucidate the role of personality traits in disease progression and may help to design more effective interventions.},

	abstract = {Objectives. Despite the well-replicated finding that neuroticism is associated with increased susceptibility for psychopathology, it remains unclear what ‘vulnerability as indexed by neuroticism’ represents in terms of everyday life emotional processes. This study examined the association between neuroticism and six phenotypes of daily life emotional responses: positive affect (PA), negative affect (NA), PA variability, NA variability, stress sensitivity, and reward experience, and investigated the contribution of genetic and environmental factors to these associations. Design. A prospective cohort study in a population-based sample of 416 adult female twins. Method. A momentary assessment approach (experience sampling method) was used to collect multiple assessments of affect in daily life. Neuroticism was assessed with the Eysenck Personality Scale. Multi-level regression analyses were carried out to examine the association between neuroticism and the phenotypes of daily life emotional responses. Cross-twin, cross-trait analyses, and bivariate structural equation modelling (SEM) were performed in order to investigate the nature of these associations. Results. A high neuroticism score was associated with lower momentary PA levels and increased NA variability, independent of momentary NA, PA variability, stress sensitivity, and reward experience. Both the cross-twin, cross-trait analyses, and the bivariate SEM showed that unique, non-shared environmental factors drive the association between neuroticism and PA and that the association between neuroticism and increased NA variability is based on shared genetic factors as well as individual-specific environmental factors. Conclusions. Neuroticism as measured by Eysenck questionnaire may index an environmental risk for decreased daily life PA levels and a genetic as well as an environmental risk for increased NA variability. Decomposing the broad measure of neuroticism into measurable persons–context interactions increases its ‘informative’ value in explaining psychopathology.},

Discrete emotions theories assume that neural, affective, and cognitive processes differ across specific emotions and that each emotion has particular motivational and regulatory functions. Thus, efforts at regulation should target the specific dysregulated emotions. The positive effects of emotion regulation are more likely to be optimized when they result from or lead to emotion utilization—the constructive use of the energy of emotion arousal. Effective processes for regulation differ for basic emotions and emotion schemas. This article identifies neural systems that facilitate emotion experiences and emotion regulation processes. It considers the implications of the developmental change from basic emotions to emotion schemas, and also briefly discusses the effects of interventions on changes in emotion knowledge, emotion regulation, and social and emotional competence.},

	abstract = {The term psi denotes anomalous processes of information or energy transfer that are currently unexplained in terms of known physical or biological mechanisms. Two variants of psi are precognition (conscious cognitive awareness) and premonition (affective apprehension) of a future event that could not otherwise be anticipated through any known inferential process. Precognition and premonition are themselves special cases of a more general phenomenon: the anomalous retroactive influence of some future event on an individual's current responses, whether those responses are conscious or nonconscious, cognitive or affective. This article reports 9 experiments, involving more than 1,000 participants, that test for retroactive influence by “time-reversing” well-established psychological effects so that the individual's responses are obtained before the putatively causal stimulus events occur. Data are presented for 4 time-reversed effects: precognitive approach to erotic stimuli and precognitive avoidance of negative stimuli; retroactive priming; retroactive habituation; and retroactive facilitation of recall. The mean effect size (d) in psi performance across all 9 experiments was 0.22, and all but one of the experiments yielded statistically significant results. The individual-difference variable of stimulus seeking, a component of extraversion, was significantly correlated with psi performance in 5 of the experiments, with participants who scored above the midpoint on a scale of stimulus seeking achieving a mean effect size of 0.43. Skepticism about psi, issues of replication, and theories of psi are also discussed.},

At baseline, there were 2071 individuals without dementia and 1511 without cognitive impairment.Results During follow-up, 462 persons developed Alzheimer disease (20 with dementia solely due to another condition were excluded). Five to six years before diagnosis, the rate of global cognitive decline accelerated more than 15-fold. The acceleration in cognitive decline occurred slightly earlier for semantic memory (76 months before diagnosis) and working memory (75 months) than other cognitive functions. Mild cognitive impairment was also preceded by years of cognitive decline that began earlier (80 months before diagnosis) and proceeded more rapidly (annual loss of 0.102 unit) in the amnestic than in the nonamnestic (62 months, 0.072 unit) subtype.Conclusion Dementia due to Alzheimer disease is preceded by about 5 to 6 years of accelerated decline in multiple cognitive functions.

Objective: To re-examine the relation of blood glucose monitoring to glycemic control among adolescents with type 1 diabetes and to evaluate the relation of demographic, behavioral, and psychosocial characteristics of adolescents who monitor more and less frequently. Research design and methods: Participants were 132 adolescents with type 1 diabetes (average age = 12 yr) and their parents, recruited from Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Adolescents were interviewed annually for five consecutive years after routine clinic appointments. At each assessment, data from blood glucose meters were downloaded and glycosylated hemoglobin A1c was recorded from medical records. Results: More frequent blood glucose monitoring was related to better glycemic control. Adolescents who monitored more frequently were younger, from higher social status families, on insulin pumps, and had higher self-efficacy. Age-related declines in blood glucose monitoring occurred among adolescents with low self-esteem, high stressful life events, and lower parental support. Conclusions: Given the importance of blood glucose monitoring for good glycemic control, future research should enhance adolescents' self-efficacy for monitoring and intervene with those who are at risk for age-related declines in blood glucose monitoring.},

	abstract = {This article tests a new model for predicting which aspects of personality are best judged by the self and which are best judged by others. Previous research suggests an asymmetry in the accuracy of personality judgments: Some aspects of personality are known better to the self than others and vice versa. According to the self–other knowledge asymmetry (SOKA) model presented here, the self should be more accurate than others for traits low in observability (e.g., neuroticism), whereas others should be more accurate than the self for traits high in evaluativeness (e.g., intellect). In the present study, 165 participants provided self-ratings and were rated by 4 friends and up to 4 strangers in a round-robin design. Participants then completed a battery of behavioral tests from which criterion measures were derived. Consistent with SOKA model predictions, the self was the best judge of neuroticism-related traits, friends were the best judges of intellect-related traits, and people of all perspectives were equally good at judging extraversion-related traits. The theoretical and practical value of articulating this asymmetry is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Neuroticism predicted worse physical health and subjective well-being in old age and, for women, higher mortality risk, but for men, neuroticism predicted decreased mortality risk. For both sexes, extraversion predicted old-age social competence, whereas conscientiousness predicted men's old-age productivity.

The purpose of this study is to examine also the extent to which any associations are accounted for by sociodemographic factors, health behaviors, and cognitive ability.MethodParticipants were 4208 men drawn from the Vietnam Experience Study. From military archives, and a later telephone interview and psychological and medical examination, sociodemographic, health behavior, cognitive ability, neuroticism, and health data were collected. Neuroticism and cognitive ability were assessed with standardized tests during the medical examination. Presence of the metabolic syndrome was based on body mass index, fasting blood glucose or a diagnosis of diabetes, high blood pressure or taking antihypertensive medication, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels.ResultsNeuroticism was positively associated with the occurrence of the metabolic syndrome and several of its components in both age-, and sociodemographic- and health behavior-adjusted analyses. Many associations were accounted for by individual difference in cognitive ability. Neuroticism was robustly associated with the number of components of the metabolic syndrome after adjustment.ConclusionsIndividuals with higher neuroticism scores had a higher prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and a larger number of its components. On the whole, differences in cognitive ability appeared to partially mediate the relationship between neuroticism and the metabolic syndrome.},

Methods: A total of 354 Catholic nuns, priests, and brothers had annual clinical evaluations for up to 13 years, died, and underwent brain autopsy. The clinical evaluations included detailed testing of cognitive function from which previously established composite measures of global cognition and specific cognitive functions were derived. As part of a uniform neuropathologic evaluation, the density of neurofibrillary tangles was summarized in a composite measure and the presence of Lewy bodies and gross and microscopic cerebral infarction was noted. Results: During follow-up, rate of global cognitive decline was gradual at first and then more than quadrupled in the last 4 to 5 years of life consistent with the onset of progressive dementia. Neurofibrillary tangles, cerebral infarction, and neocortical Lewy bodies all contributed to gradual age-related cognitive decline and little age-related decline was evident in the absence of these lesions. Neurofibrillary tangles and neocortical Lewy bodies contributed to precipitous disease-related cognitive decline, but substantial disease-related decline was evident even in the absence of these lesions. Conclusion: Mild age-related decline in cognitive function is mainly due to the neuropathologic lesions traditionally associated with dementia. GLOSSARYAD \&equals; Alzheimer disease.},

Design. Analysis of data from subjects (N = 415) enrolled in an ongoing randomized controlled trial. Methods. Regression analyses were conducted to explore whether Five Factor Model (FFM) personality factors moderated the effects of HIOH, delivered in subjects' homes or via telephone, on disease management self-efficacy. Data were collected at 6 time points over the course of 1 year. Results. Compared with control and telephone HIOH, home HIOH significantly increased self-efficacy, an effect peaking at 6 weeks and fully attenuating by 1year. Moderation analyses revealed the benefit was confined to patients higher in neuroticism and/or lower in conscientiousness, agreeableness, and extraversion. Conclusions. A peer led intervention to enhance disease management self-efficacy had only short-term effects, and FFM personality factors moderated those effects. Measuring personality factors in chronically ill individuals may facilitate targeting of self-management interventions to those most likely to respond.},

	abstract = {Diabetes costs represent a large burden to both patients and the health care system. However, few studies that examine the economic consequences of diabetes have distinguished between the two major forms, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, despite differences in underlying pathologies. Combining the two diseases implies that there is no difference between the costs of type 1 and type 2 diabetes to a patient. In this study, we examine the costs of type 1 diabetes, which is often overlooked due to the larger population of type 2 patients, and compare them to the estimated costs of diabetes reported in the literature. Using a nationally representative dataset, we estimate yearly and lifetime medical and indirect costs of type 1 diabetes by implementing a matching method to compare a patient with type 1 diabetes to a similar individual without the disease. We find that each year type 1 diabetes costs this country \$14.4 billion (11.5–17.3) in medical costs and lost income. In terms of lost income, type 1 patients incur a disproportionate share of type 1 and type 2 costs. Further, if the disease were eliminated by therapeutic intervention, an estimated \$10.6 billion (7.2–14.0) incurred by a new cohort and \$422.9 billion (327.2–519.4) incurred by the existing number of type 1 diabetic patients over their lifetime would be avoided. We find that the costs attributed to type 1 diabetes are disproportionately higher than the number of type 1 patients compared with type 2 patients, suggesting that combining the two diseases when estimating costs is not appropriate. This study and another recent contribution provides a necessary first step in estimating the substantial costs of type 1 diabetes on the U.S.},

Design. Analysis of data from 384 subjects completing a randomized controlled trial of HIOH. Methods. Regression analyses examined effects of NEO-five factor inventory scores on SF-36 mental component summary (MCS-36) and physical component summary (PCS-36) scores (baseline; 2, 4, and 6 weeks; 6 months; 1 year), adjusting for age, gender, and study group. Results. Baseline MCS-36 scores were worse in those with the distressed personality profile relative to others: high neuroticism (13.3 points worse, 95\% confidence interval (CI)=11.0, 15.7) and low conscientiousness (6.6 points worse, 95\% CI=4.1, 9.2), extraversion (10.1 points worse, 95\% CI=7.7, 12.5) and agreeableness (4.2 points worse, 95\% CI=1.6, 6.8).

	abstract = {Hyperglycemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients and strict glycemic control has become standard care for adults. Recent studies have questioned the optimal targets for such management and reported increased rates of iatrogenic hypoglycemia in both critically ill children and adults. The ability to provide accurate, real-time continuous glucose monitoring would improve the efficacy and safety of this practice in critically ill patients. The aim of our study is to determine if a continuous, interstitial glucose monitor will correlate with blood glucose values in critically ill children. We evaluated 50 critically ill children age 6 weeks to 16 years old with a commercially available continuous glucose monitor (CGM; Medtronic Guardian®). CGM values and standard blood glucose (BG) values were compared. During the study, no changes in patient management were made based on CGM readings alone. Forty-seven patients had analyzable CGM data. A total of 1,555 CGM and routine BG measurements were compared using Clarke error grid and Bland-Altman analysis. For all readings, 97.9\% were within clinically acceptable agreement. The mean absolute relative difference between CGM and BG readings was 15.3\%. For the 1,555 paired CGM and BG measurements, there is a statistically significant linear relationship between CGM values and BG (P {\textless}.0001). A high degree of clinical agreement existed in three subpopulation analyses based on age, illness severity, and support measures. This included some of our smallest patients (that is, {\textless}12 months old), those who required vasopressors, and those who were treated for critical illness hyperglycemia. In one of the largest studies to date, in a highly vulnerable ICU population, CGM values have a clinically acceptable correlation with the BG values now used diagnostically and therapeutically. Our data contest the theoretical concerns posed by some regarding CGM use in the ICU. The existing medical evidence may now support a role for CGM devices in the identification and management of hyperglycemia in diverse ICU settings.},

Nonadherence is tightly linked to suboptimal glycemic control, increasing morbidity, and risk for premature mortality. This article will review barriers to adherence and discuss interventions that have shown promise in improving outcomes for this population. Recent findings Adolescents face numerous obstacles to adherence, including developmental behaviors, flux in family dynamics, and perceived social pressures, which compound the relative insulin resistance brought on by pubertal physiology. Some successful interventions have relied on encouraging nonjudgmental family support in the daily tasks of blood glucose monitoring and insulin administration. Other interventions overcome these barriers through the use of motivational interviewing and problem-solving techniques, flexibility in dietary recommendations, and extending provider outreach and support with technology. Summary Effective interventions build on teens' internal and external supports (family, technology, and internal motivation) in order to simplify their management of diabetes and provide opportunities for the teens to share the burdens of care. Although such strategies help to minimize the demands placed upon teens with diabetes, suboptimal glycemic control will likely persist for the majority of adolescents until technological breakthroughs allow for automated insulin delivery in closed loop systems.},

In order to test these propositions, age differences in reward-seeking and impulsivity were examined in a socioeconomically and ethnically diverse sample of 935 individuals between the ages of 10 and 30, using self-report and behavioral measures of each construct. Consistent with predictions, age differences in reward-seeking follow a curvilinear pattern, increasing between preadolescence and mid-adolescence, and declining thereafter. In contrast, age differences in impulsivity follow a linear pattern, with impulsivity declining steadily from age 10 on. Heightened vulnerability to risk-taking in middle adolescence may be due to the combination of relatively higher inclinations to seek rewards and still maturing capacities for self-control. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Knowledge of effective ways of coping with HIV is critical to help individuals with HIV maintain the best possible psychological and physical well-being. The purpose of the present article is to determine, through meta-analysis, the strength of the evidence regarding 2 questions: (a) Which types of coping are related to psychological and physical well-being among people with HIV? and (b) Do contextual (pre?post introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapies [HAART]; time since diagnosis), measurement (HIV-related event vs. generic prompts for coping measurement), or individual (gender) variables affect the extent to which coping is related to physical and psychological well-being? The authors' analysis demonstrates that Direct Action and Positive Reappraisal were consistently associated with better outcomes in people coping with HIV across affective, health behavior, and physical health categories. In contrast, disengagement forms of coping, such as Behavioral Disengagement and Use of Alcohol or Drugs to Cope, were consistently associated with poorer outcomes. The findings also indicate that in some cases, coping effectiveness was dependent on contextual factors, including time since diagnosis and the advent of HAART.

	abstract = {Patients’ self-care behaviours have a major role in diabetes management. Diabetes education provides the required knowledge, but despite this, self-care is often suboptimal. The degree to which patients follow advice as regards the various self-care behaviours is determined by their health beliefs (Illness Representations or Personal Models) of diabetes. Psychometric studies have tried to categorize and measure the beliefs about illness that influence patients to adhere to treatment recommendations in diabetes. Various models have been proposed to explain the relationship between beliefs and behaviour. Leventhal's Self-Regulatory Model, which takes account of the emotional as well as the objective rational response to illness, currently seems to offer the best system for identifying the determinants of patient self-care behaviour. A review of interventions indicates those based on psychological theory offer professionals the best chance of maximizing their patients’ contribution to diabetes self-management and achieving improved outcomes, both glycaemic and psychosocial. Studies designed specifically to modify illness representations are now being undertaken. This brief review aims to summarize developments in this area of psychological theory over the last 20 years and the implications for promoting better self-care behaviour in diabetes.},

College students (N = 234) and older adults (N = 116) read a scenario about a person with a suspicious mole that varied in the controllability, likelihood, and severity of the outcomes. Consistent with our predictions, people prefer Watchful Waiting when controllability, likelihood, and severity are low, Active Change when controllability and likelihood are high, and Acceptance when controllability is low.

	abstract = {One of the fundamental questions in personality psychology is whether and how strongly trait standing relates to the traits that people actually manifest in their behavior when faced with real pressures and real consequences of their actions. One reason this question is fundamental is the common belief that traits do not predict how individuals behave, which leads to the reasonable conclusion that traits are not important to study. However, this conclusion is surprising given that there is almost no data on the ability of traits to predict distributions of naturally occurring, representative behaviors of individuals (and that there are many studies showing that traits do indeed predict specific behaviors). The authors describe a meta-analysis of 15 experience-sampling studies, conducted over the course of 8 years, amassing over 20,000 reports of trait manifestation in behavior. Participants reported traits on typical self-report questionnaires, then described their current behavior multiple times per day for several days as the behavior was occurring. Results show that traits, contrary to expectations, were strongly predictive of individual differences in trait manifestation in behavior, predicting average levels with correlations between .42 and .56 (approaching .60 for stringently restricted studies). Several other ways of summarizing trait manifestation in behavior were also predicted from traits. These studies provide evidence that traits are powerful predictors of actual manifestation of traits in behavior.},

	abstract = {Aims. Decision‐making is an important prerequisite for empowerment. The aim of this study was to explore teenagers’ perceptions of factors affecting decision‐making competence in diabetes management. Background. A previous study that assessed an empowerment programme for teenagers with diabetes showed no effects on metabolic control or empowerment outcomes, which is not in accordance with results from studies on adult diabetes patients. The definition of empowerment highlights the patient’s own responsibility for decision‐making. Earlier studies have shown that many teenagers’ may not be mature in decision‐making competence until late adolescence. To explore the significance of decision‐making competence on the effectiveness of empowerment education we wanted to explore teenagers’ own view on factors affecting this competence. Design. An explorative, qualitative interview study was conducted with 31 teenagers with type 1 diabetes, aged 12–17 years. Methods. The teenagers were interviewed two weeks after completing an empowerment education programme. The interviews were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results. Five categories stood out as important for decision‐making competence: cognitive maturity, personal qualities, experience, social network and parent involvement. Based on the content in the interviews and the five categories, we made an interpretation and formulated an overall theme: ‘Teenagers deserve respect and support for their short‐comings during the maturity process’. Conclusion. Our conclusion is that teenagers deserve respect for their immature decision‐making competence. Decision‐making competence was described as cognitive abilities, personal qualifications and experience. To compensate for the deficiencies the teenagers deserve constructive support from their social network and the essential support is expected to come from their parents. Relevance to clinical practice. These findings can be useful for diabetes team members in supporting teenagers with diabetes and their parents both in individual meetings and when planning and delivering group education.},

	abstract = {Adolescents with diabetes are at increased risk of developing psychiatric (10–20\%) or eating disorders (8–30\%), as well as substance abuse (25–50\%), leading to non-compliance with treatment and deterioration of diabetic control. At high risk are female adolescents with family problems and other comorbid disorders. Impaired cognitive function has also been reported among children with diabetes, mainly in boys, and especially in those with early diabetes diagnosis ({\textless} 5 years), or with episodes of severe hypoglycaemia or prolonged hyperglycaemia. Type 1 diabetes mellitus contributes to the development of problems in parent–child relationships and employment difficulties, and negatively affects the quality of life. However, insulin pumps appear to improve patients’ metabolic control and lifestyle. The contributions of family and friends to the quality of metabolic control and emotional support are also crucial. In addition, the role of the primary-care provider is important in identifying patients at high risk of developing psychosocial disorders and referring them on to health specialists. At high risk are patients in mid-adolescence with comorbid disorders, low socioeconomic status or parental health problems. Multisystem therapy, involving the medical team, school personnel, family and peer group, is also essential. The present review focuses on the prevalence of nutritional and psychosocial problems among adolescents with diabetes, and the risk factors for its development, and emphasizes specific goals in their management and prevention.},

	abstract = {As part of the Health and Lifestyle Survey (HALS), 6096 adults from a representative sample of community residents completed a standardized questionnaire which elicited psychiatric symptoms – the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-30) of Goldberg (1972). Their survival status at 7 years was determined, and 474 had died. Respondents whose GHQ score was above the conventional threshold (4/5), used when screening for psychiatric disorder, were 60\% more likely to die over the 7-year interval than respondents whose GHQ score was below threshold (risk ratio 1·64 for men and 1·58 for women). The differences were statistically significant for both sexes when the effects of age, physical disorder, social class and smoking behaviour were taken into account. Personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion) were not related to mortality, neither was self-reported difficulty in sleeping. However, a low subjective rating of one's general health was associated with increased mortality. We explored a range of cut-points and found reliable effects for both sexes at all cut-points from 3/4 to 6/7. Possible differences related to natural versus unnatural causes of death were explored and found not to explain the results. The findings from this general population study confirm that it is not only psychiatric disorders, but also psychiatric symptoms, which are associated with subsequent mortality, and thereby reinforce the importance of appropriate intervention to alleviate these symptoms.},

Participants (n = 423) received blood pressure and cholesterol feedback and listed their thoughts afterwards. A network of reactions to health risk feedback was constructed from the responses. Emotions, risk feedback valence, future lifestyle, and expectedness emerged as strong and largely well-connected network nodes, while previously well-researched reactions like feedback acceptance formed small, less connected nodes. The majority of reaction patterns identified through the network appeared adaptive, even after negative feedback. The network provides a potentially useful tool for research and practice, highlighting previously neglected relevant reactions, and providing a group-level background against which individual reactions can be evaluated.},

A 1 sample deviation (SD) increase in extroversion (i.e., 50th versus 83rd population percentile) increased the odds of ED use by 51\% (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] [95\% CI] = 1.51 [1.03–2.21], z = 2.12, N = 923, p = 0.034). A 1-SD decrease in agreeableness (i.e., 50th versus 17th population percentile) increased odds of ED use by 54\% (AOR [95\% CI] = 1.54 [1.05–2.22], z = −2.25, N = 923, p = 0.034).Conclusion:The greater assertiveness and social confidence signified by lower agreeableness and higher extroversion may help older adults overcome potential barriers to the ED. Overly introverted and agreeable older adults may require special encouragement to access the ED—particularly for time-sensitive conditions—to reduce morbidity and mortality.},

	abstract = {Objective: To examine the association of positive and negative aspects of friendship to psychological well-being, self-care behavior, and blood glucose control and to determine whether these relations were moderated by gender. Design: Adolescents with Type 1 diabetes (n = 76) completed baseline measures of friendship quality, depressive symptoms, and self-care. A measure of metabolic control was obtained from medical records. Adolescents also tested blood glucose periodically over the course of 4 days and completed ecological momentary assessments of interpersonal interactions and mood using PDAs. Main Outcome Measures: For between-groups analyses, primary outcomes were depressive symptoms, self-care behavior, and metabolic control. For within-groups analyses, primary outcomes were mood and blood glucose. Results: Results showed baseline reports of peer conflict but not support were associated with outcomes, particularly among girls. Conflict was more strongly related to poor metabolic control for girls than boys. Momentary interaction enjoyment and interaction upset were associated with mood, but were unrelated to blood glucose. Aggregate indices of enjoyable interactions were associated with fewer depressive symptoms and better self-care—especially among girls. Conclusions: These results suggest that the positive and negative aspects of peer relationships are related to the psychological well-being and physical health of adolescents with diabetes.},

Body satisfaction was assessed immediately before and after commercial viewing. Appearance evaluation and orientation were also examined as moderating variables. It was found that exposure to muscular-ideal television commercials led to lower muscle satisfaction and physical attractiveness than nonappearance commercials, with men high on appearance orientation the most vulnerable. Men high on appearance orientation also engaged in greater upward social comparison to muscular-ideal images which, in turn, predicted changes in body satisfaction.

In a community sample (N = 274) and a representative statewide sample (N = 613) of 18- to 94-year-olds, self-reported industriousness, impulse control, and reliability showed age differences from early adulthood to middle age, whereas orderliness did not. The transition into late adulthood was characterized by increases in impulse control, reliability, and conventionality. In contrast, age differences in observer-rated personality occurred mainly in older adulthood. Age differences held across both ethnicity and levels of socioeconomic status.

This study examines detailed personality profiles of underweight, normal, and overweight individuals to provide insights into the causes and treatments of abnormal weight. Methods: More than half of the population from four towns in Sardinia, Italy (n \&equals; 5693; age \&equals; 14–94 years; mean ± standard deviation \&equals; 43 ± 17 years) were assessed on multiple anthropometric measures and 30 facets that comprehensively cover the five major dimensions of personality, using the Revised NEO Personality Inventory. Results: High Neuroticism and low Conscientiousness were associated with being underweight and obese, respectively. High Impulsiveness (specifically eating-behavior items) and low Order were associated with body mass index categories of overweight and obese, and with measures of abdominal adiposity (waist and hip circumference). Those scoring in the top 10\% of Impulsiveness were about 4 kg heavier than those in the bottom 10\%, an effect independent and larger than the FTO genetic variant. Prospective analyses confirmed that Impulsiveness and Order were significant predictors of general and central measures of adiposity assessed 3 years later. Conclusions: Overweight and obese individuals have difficulty resisting cravings and lack methodical and organized behaviors that might influence diet and weight control. Although individuals’ traits have limited impact on the current obesogenic epidemic, personality traits can improve clinical assessment, suggest points of intervention, and help tailor prevention and treatment approaches.

We explored the consequences of comorbid anxiety for emotional distress, functional impairment, health care utilization, and health behavior in dizziness.MethodsBy the end of 2006, we surveyed a total of 1287 persons between 14 and 90 years of age in their homes by trained interviewers with standardized self-rating questionnaires on anxiety (Patient Health Questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Mini-Social Phobia Inventory) and dizziness (Vertigo Symptom Scale). The sample was representative for the German population in terms of age, sex, and education.ResultsSymptoms of dizziness were reported by 15.8\% of the participants. Of the participants with dizziness, 28.3\% reported symptoms of at least one anxiety disorder (generalized anxiety, social phobia, panic). Persons with dizziness reported more somatic problems such as hypertension, migraine, diabetes, etc. Comorbid anxiety was associated with increased health care use and impairment.ConclusionDizziness is a highly prevalent symptom in the general population. A subgroup with comorbid anxiety is characterized by an increased subjective impairment and health care utilization due to their dizziness. Because treatment options for distinct neurotologic disorders are also known to reduce psychological symptoms, and in order to avoid unnecessary medical treatment, early neurologic and psychiatric/psychotherapeutic referral may be indicated.},

Methods: Community-residing women (n \&equals; 108) participated in a combined concurrent-retrospective design. Physical symptoms were assessed concurrently over 21 consecutive days followed by a retrospective assessment of the collective symptom experience for the same time period. Results: Based on evidence of differences in cognitive processing of emotion-relevant material, we predicted and found that depressive symptomatology (at baseline) was a stronger predictor of inflated physical symptom recall than N/NA. Depressive symptomatology was also a stronger, independent predictor of concurrent physical symptoms. Notably, these results were obtained even when physical depressive symptoms in both the physical symptom checklist and the baseline depression assessment were eliminated. Conclusions: The results suggest that the classic symptom perception hypothesis should be refined and operationalized in terms of depressive symptomatology rather than N/NA. This study demonstrates how cognitive-affective processing differences associated with depressive symptomatology can shed additional light on the psychology of symptom perception.

	abstract = {Examines whether the positive association between social support and well-being is attributable more to an overall beneficial effect of support (main- or direct-effect model) or to a process of support protecting persons from potentially adverse effects of stressful events (buffering model). The review of studies is organized according to (1) whether a measure assesses support structure (the existence of relationships) or function (the extent to which one's interpersonal relationships provide particular resources) and (2) the degree of specificity (vs globality) of the scale. Special attention is given to methodological characteristics that are requisite for a fair comparison of the models. It is concluded that there is evidence consistent with both models. Evidence for the buffering model is found when the social support measure assesses the perceived availability of interpersonal resources that are responsive to the needs elicited by stressful events. Evidence for a main effect model is found when the support measure assesses a person's degree of integration in a large social network. Both conceptualizations of social support are correct in some respects, but each represents a different process through which social support may affect well-being. Implications for theories of social support processes and for the design of preventive interventions are discussed. (4 p ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

These models are illustrated by selected data. In the concluding section, an evaluation of the project is offered in terms of future directions for research.},

Ss were administered the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Beck Depression Inventory. Words (either threat related or neutral) were simultaneously presented on 2 areas of the screen of a microcomputer. The ensuing distribution of visual attention was measured. Findings indicate that clinically anxious (but not clinically depressed) Ss consistently shifted attention toward threat words, resulting in reduced detection latencies for probes appearing in the vicinity of such stimuli. Control Ss, on the other hand, tended to shift attention away from such material. Results support the existence of anxiety-related encoding bias. It is suggested that this cognitive mechanism may contribute to the maintenance of such mood disorders. (27 ref)},

Results show that personality characteristics were related to life outcomes across the 1st 20 yrs of adulthood. 70 Ss who had their 1st child by age 28 were on the feminine social clockwork; 20 Ss were late adherents, having their 1st child after age 28; remaining Ss followed neither social clock pattern, or they followed a masculine occupational clock. It is suggested that, having described social clock projects and their normative time parameters, the relative goodness of fit between individuals' needs and the ecology of nested contexts in which they feel they must try to gratify them can be examined.

Differences between people in these measures can be explained simply by differences in their genes and in their individual environmental experiences. There is no evidence that environmental experiences that are shared by cotwins, such as common family environment or social influences, are important. There are differences between the sexes in gene action affecting neuroticism, and genetic effects become more pronounced with age in females. The lack of evidence for dominance variance affecting neuroticism contrasts well with the detection of considerable genetical nonadditivity for extraversion in the same sample and reinforces the view that these two traits are not only statistically, but also genetically, quite independent. An analysis of the causes of covariation between anxiety, depression, and neuroticism shows that additive gene effects are more important causes of covariation than environmental factors. Genetic variation in symptoms of anxiety and depression is largely dependent on the same factors as effect the neuroticism trait. However, there is also evidence for genetic variation specific to depression.},

This reflects that the fundamental questions that motivated this book thirty years ago are still being asked. But more important, the answers – or at least their outlines – now seem to be in sight. In 1968, this book stood as an expression of a paradigm crisis in its critique of the state of personality psychology. The last three decades have been filled with controversy and debate about the dilemmas raised here, and then with renewal and fresh discoveries. It therefore seems especially timely to revisit the pages which posed the challenges. Mischel outlined the need to encompass the situation in the study of personality, but with a focus on the acquired meaning of stimuli and on the situation as perceived, viewing the individual as a cognitive-affective being who construes, interprets, and transforms the stimulus in a dynamic reciprocal interaction with the social world. He focused on the idiographic analysis of personality that had originally motivated the field, and the complexity, discriminative facility, and uniqueness of the individual, and sought to connect the expressions of personality to the individual's behavior – that is, to what people do and not just what they say. Even the intrinsically contextualized "if...then..." expressions of the personality system – its essential behavioral signatures – were foreshadowed in this book that fired the opening salvo in a search for "a truly dynamic personality psychology."},

	abstract = {We introduce a new method, differential language analysis (DLA), for studying human development in which computational linguistics are used to analyze the big data available through online social media in light of psychological theory. Our open vocabulary DLA approach finds words, phrases, and topics that distinguish groups of people based on 1 or more characteristics. Using a data set of over 70,000 Facebook users, we identify how word and topic use vary as a function of age and compile cohort specific words and phrases into visual summaries that are face valid and intuitively meaningful. We demonstrate how this methodology can be used to test developmental hypotheses, using the aging positivity effect (Carstensen \& Mikels, 2005) as an example. While in this study we focused primarily on common trends across age-related cohorts, the same methodology can be used to explore heterogeneity within developmental stages or to explore other characteristics that differentiate groups of people. Our comprehensive list of words and topics is available on our web site for deeper exploration by the research community.},

	abstract = {The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that neural processes for language are heterogeneous in their adaptations to maturation and experience. This study examined whether the neural processes for open-and closed-class words are differentially affected by delays in second-language immersion. In English, open-class words primarily convey referential meaning, whereas closed-class words are primarily related to grammatical information in sentence processing. Previous studies indicate that event-related brain potentials (ERPs) elicited by these word classes display nonidentical distributions and latencies, show different developmental time courses, and are differentially affected by early language experience in Deaf individuals. In this study, ERPs were recorded from 10 monolingual English speakers and 53 Chinese-English bilingual speakers who were grouped according to their age of immersion in English: 1-3, 4-6, 7-10, 11-13, and {\textgreater}15 years of age. Closed-class words elicited an N280 that was largest over left anterior electrode sites for all groups. However, the peak latency was later ({\textgreater}35 ms) in bilingual speakers immersed in English after 7 years of age. In contrast, the latencies and distributions of the N350 elicited by open-class words were similar in all groups. In addition, the N400, elicited by semantic anomalies (open-class words that violated semantic expectation), displayed increased peak latencies for only the later-learning bilingual speakers ({\textgreater}11 years). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that language subprocesses are differentially sensitive to the timing of second-language experience.},

Although the field is only 25 years old, it has burgeoned into a major scientific and clinical discipline. Health psychology has excellent scientific journals, thousands of scientists and practitioners, and many students. Yet, there has not been a sufficient statement or explication of the foundational concepts upon which this flourishing field is built. Foundations of Health Psychology brings together top experts to provide a much-needed conceptual base for this rapidly expanding field. Rather than take a medical model approach, the volume examines health psychology from a theoretical, conceptual, and psychological perspective. After presenting an overview of the field's history and methods, the contributors address core concepts of the biopsychosocial approach to health and then discuss applications to health promotion and illness prevention and treatment. Providing a deep understanding of the intellectual foundations of health psychology, this volume will be invaluable for both new and experienced researchers, as well as students and other scholars seeking a firm basis for successful research and practice.},

Forty-two of these individuals participated in a follow-up 2 years later. Foreshadowing and happy endings in the stories were related to heightened SWB at both time periods. Evidence of accommodative change—actively experiencing a paradigmatic shift—was related to stress-related growth and ego development at both time periods.

His insights into the interdependence of the individuals' growth and historical change, his now-famous concepts of identity, growth, and the life cycle, have changed the way we perceive ourselves and society. Widely read and cited, his works have won numerous awards including the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award.  Combining the insights of clinical psychoanalysis with a new approach to cultural anthropology, Childhood and Society deals with the relationships between childhood training and cultural accomplishment, analyzing the infantile and the mature, the modern and the archaic elements in human motivation. It was hailed upon its first publication as "a rare and living combination of European and American thought in the human sciences" (Margaret Mead, The American Scholar). Translated into numerous foreign languages, it has gone on to become a classic in the study of the social significance of childhood.},

DESIGN: The model was tested on 1,054 members of the Hawaii Personality and Health cohort, which is a population-based cohort participating in a longitudinal study of personality and health spanning 40 years from childhood to midlife. OUTCOME: Childhood Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Intellect-Imagination influenced adult health status indirectly through educational attainment, healthy eating habits, and smoking. Several direct effects of childhood traits on health behaviors and health status were also observed. CONCLUSION: The model extends past associations found between personality traits and health behaviors or health status by identifying a life-course pathway based on the health behavior model through which early childhood traits influence adult health status. The additional direct effects of personality traits indicate that health behavior mechanisms may not provide a complete account of relations between personality and health.},

	abstract = {Three coefficients of factor similarity were examined with regard to their behaviour within four sets of data. Two simple methods using Pearson r correlations and Tucker Congruence coefficients were compared with a more complex method given by Kaiser, Hunka and Bianchini (1971). Three of the data sets involved the use of 100 random data matrices, the fourth was that provided by the Eysencks' work on cross-cultural differences in personality using the EPQ. Drawbacks with each other coefficient were apparent from the results, with the Kaiser et al. coefficient being capable of the most misleading results overall. However, use of the mean solution cosine in addition to the variable pair cosines was suggested as a method of validating the Kaiser et al. coefficient. It was concluded that using the three coefficients simultaneously as a multiple indicator yielded the best solution to the problem. In addition, it was suggested that other psychometric indicators should be employed to increase the degree of certainty of factor similarity.},

To assess the cross-cultural generalizability of the FFM, data from studies using 6 translations of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (P. T. Costa \& R. R. McCrae, 1992) were compared with the American factor structure. German, Portuguese, Hebrew, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese samples (N = 7,134) showed similar structures after varimax rotation of 5 factors. When targeted rotations were used, the American factor structure was closely reproduced, even at the level of secondary loadings. Because the samples studied represented highly diverse cultures with languages from 5 distinct language families, these data strongly suggest that personality trait structure is universal.},

It reviews the cross-cultural evidence on the behavior of women and men in nonindustrial societies, especially the activities that contribute to the sex-typed division of labor and patriarchy. To explain the cross-cultural findings, the authors consider social constructionism, evolutionary psychology, and their own biosocial theory. Supporting the biosocial analysis, sex differences derive from the interaction between the physical specialization of the sexes, especially female reproductive capacity, and the economic and social structural aspects of societies. This biosocial approach treats the psychological attributes of women and men as emergent given the evolved characteristics of the sexes, their developmental experiences, and their situated activity in society.},

The reasons for these associations, however, are complex and the pathways insufficiently studied. This article employs a life-span data set to explore how childhood personality relates to health-related growth and development (dynamisms), patterns of reactions and health behaviors (mechanisms), and movements toward and away from suitable environments (tropisms). Illustrations from the 7-decade Terman longitudinal data reveal important areas in which previous, cross-sectional research has misinterpreted associations between personality and health. In particular, Sociability has been overrated as a life-span health risk factor, Conscientiousness has been underrated, and Neuroticism has been confused. Without sufficient attention to the processes underlying the associations between personality and health, significant suboptimal allocations of intervention resources result.},

	abstract = {Attributional biases in close relationships can take the form of either an actor-observer bias (i. e., attributions to partner dispositions) or an egocentric bias (self-attributions). Hence, different theoretical approaches lead to contradictory predictions. To resolve this conflict, the language used to describe one's own and one's partner's behavior was analyzed. Free descriptions were coded with respect to sentence subjects (self vs. partner) and the abstractness of Predicates. Evidence was found for both types of biases, though at different levels of language use. An actor-observer bias was obtained at the abstract level of adjectives, whereas an egocentric bias was found at the level of interpretive action verbs (i.e., manifest behaviors). Language use is also shown to be related to satisfaction with the partnership, action verbs being a better predictor than adjectives. The role of language in mediating or elucidating social cognitive phenomena is discussed.},

Dispositional mindfulness, defined in terms of being attentive and aware (versus not) of present-moment reality, appears to mitigate negative reactivity tendencies. The present two studies, involving 289 undergraduate participants, sought to integrate these two personality-processing perspectives. Neuroticism was an inverse predictor of mindfulness and both neuroticism and mindfulness independently predicted trait anger (Study 1) and depressive symptoms (Study 2). Of more importance, neuroticism-outcome relations were stronger (weaker) among individuals low (high) in mindfulness. The results document the role that dispositional mindfulness appears to play in moderating neuroticism's pernicious correlates.

Using data from 181 participants, the present study correlated word use within a 1-hr life history interview with self-judgments of personality, judgments of personality provided by close acquaintances (who were not exposed to the language sample), and behavioral ratings based on direct observation from a context entirely separate from that from which the language sample was derived. Several categories of word use yielded a large number of correlates with self- and acquaintance personality ratings and behavior. It is suggested that word use is related to personality to a larger degree than previously observed and deserves increased attention as a source of data in personality assessment.},

The goal of the current study was to further delineate gender differences in the correlates of self-focus as measured through the frequency of spontaneous use of self-referencing words. The frequency of such word use during a life history interview was correlated with self-reports, observations by clinically trained interviewers, and personality judgments by acquaintances. Results indicated that the relationship between self-reference and observations of depressive symptoms was stronger for women than men, and the relationship between self-reference and narcissistic authority and entitlement was stronger for men than for women. Acquaintance ratings supported these correlates. These findings illuminate the importance of using multiple measures and paying attention to gender differences in research on self-focus.},

This study examined the association between hostility, measured by the eight-item Cynical Distrust Scale, and risk for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and incident myocardial infarction. Subjects were 2,125 men, ages 42-60 years, from the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study, a longitudinal study of unestablished and traditional risk factors for ischemic heart disease, mortality, and other outcomes. There were 177 deaths (73 cardiovascular) in 9 years of follow-up. Men with hostility scores in the top quartile were at more than twice the risk of all-cause mortality (relative hazards (RH) 2.30, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.47-3.59) and cardiovascular mortality (RH 2.70, 95\% CI 1.27-5.76), relative to men with scores in the lowest quartile. Among 1,599 men without previous myocardial infarction or angina, high scorers also had an increased risk of myocardial infarction (RH 2.18, 95\% CI 1.01-4.70). Biologic and socioeconomic risk factors, social support, and prevalent diseases had minimal impact on these associations, whereas adjustments for the behavioral risk factors of smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and body mass index substantially weakened the relations. Simultaneous risk factor adjustment eliminated the observed associations. Results show that high levels of hostility are associated with increased risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality and incident myocardial infarction and that these effects are mediated primarily through behavioral risk factors.},

	abstract = {In 1861, the French surgeon, Pierre Paul Broca, described two patients who had lost the ability to speak after injury to the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the brain. Since that time, an infinite number of clinical and functional imaging studies have relied on this brain-behaviour relationship as their anchor for the localization of speech functions. Clinical studies of Broca's aphasia often assume that the deficits in these patients are due entirely to dysfunction in Broca's area, thereby attributing all aspects of the disorder to this one brain region. Moreover, functional imaging studies often rely on activation in Broca's area as verification that tasks have successfully tapped speech centres. Despite these strong assumptions, the range of locations ascribed to Broca's area varies broadly across studies. In addition, recent findings with language-impaired patients have suggested that other regions also play a role in speech production, some of which are medial to the area originally described by Broca on the lateral surface of the brain. Given the historical significance of Broca's original patients and the increasing reliance on Broca's area as a major speech centre, we thought it important to re-inspect these brains to determine the precise location of their lesions as well as other possible areas of damage. Here we describe the results of high resolution magnetic resonance imaging of the preserved brains of Broca's two historic patients. We found that both patients' lesions extended significantly into medial regions of the brain, in addition to the surface lesions observed by Broca. Results also indicate inconsistencies between the area originally identified by Broca and what is now called Broca's area, a finding with significant ramifications for both lesion and functional neuroimaging studies of this well-known brain area.},

	abstract = {Deciding whether an unfamiliar person is trustworthy is one of the most important decisions in social environments. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to show that the amygdala is involved in implicit evaluations of trustworthiness of faces, consistent with prior findings. The amygdala response increased as perceived trustworthiness decreased in a task that did not demand person evaluation. More importantly, we tested whether this response is due to an individual's idiosyncratic perception or to face properties that are perceived as untrustworthy across individuals. The amygdala response was better predicted by consensus ratings of trustworthiness than by an individual's own judgments. Individual judgments accounted for little residual variance in the amygdala after controlling for the shared variance with consensus ratings. These findings suggest that the amygdala automatically categorizes faces according to face properties commonly perceived to signal untrustworthiness.},

Mediator effects of TPB concepts in the personality-fruit consumption link, as well as moderator effects of personality in the intention-fruit consumption link, were therefore investigated in the present study. Data on fruit consumption, TPB concepts and FFM dimensions were gathered among 405 respondents in face-to-face interviews using questionnaires. Structural equation modelling was used to investigate the mediator and moderator effects. The direct effect of conscientiousness on fruit consumption was mediated by attitude and perceived behavioural control, while no direct effect of neuroticism on fruit consumption was found. Neuroticism moderated the intention-fruit consumption relationship with the weakest relationship for those scoring high on neuroticism. Conscientiousness did not moderate the intention-fruit consumption relationship. TPB variables are mediators in the conscientiousness-fruit consumption link. Whether fruit consumption is intentional may be dependent upon the personality dimension neuroticism. Personality dimensions may be a useful addition to the TPB and should be considered in health behaviour change interventions.},

Simple correlations indicated significant direct effects of conscientiousness (self-reported smoking, times 3 and 4), extraversion (time 4 smoking) and neuroticism (all smoking measures) on smoking. Logistic regression showed intention, and the interaction between conscientiousness and intention to significantly predict both self-reported and objectively assessed smoking (both at time 3) after controlling for other variables. Multiple regression showed intentions, family smoking and the interaction between conscientiousness and intention to significantly predict self-reported smoking at time 4 after controlling for other variables.

Data on 7,511 discrete sexual events collected from a community sample of 1,946 young adults were analyzed with multilevel modeling. Results showed that meaningful between-persons differences in risky sexual behavior exist and that these differences are predictable in theoretically reasonable ways by interindividual differences in personality. However, the majority of variance in risky behaviors was at the within-person level and could be reliably explained by within-person changes in personality, the situation, and the relationship context. Finally, personality interacted with context such that personality more strongly predicted risky behaviors in contexts that were ostensibly novel and ambiguous. Together these results suggest that risky sexual behaviors cannot be understood in a static, typical, or decontextualized way but rather must be viewed as a complex product of the person, the situation, and the relationship context.},

Depressive symptoms, marital stress, support perceptions, and support behavior (assessed using observational procedures) were assessed initially and 1 year later. Results provided evidence of marital stress generation among wives, and social support processes functioned as a mechanism of stress generation for wives.

	abstract = {The bulk of personality research has been built from self-report measures of personality. However, collecting personality ratings from other-raters, such as family, friends, and even strangers, is a dramatically underutilized method that allows better explanation and prediction of personality's role in many domains of psychology. Drawing hypotheses from D. C. Funder's (1995) realistic accuracy model about trait and information moderators of accuracy, we offer 3 meta-analyses to help researchers and applied psychologists understand and interpret both consistencies and unique insights afforded by other-ratings of personality. These meta-analyses integrate findings based on 44,178 target individuals rated across 263 independent samples. Each meta-analysis assessed the accuracy of observer ratings, as indexed by interrater consensus/reliability (Study 1), self-other correlations (Study 2), and predictions of behavior (Study 3). The results show that although increased frequency of interacting with targets does improve accuracy in rating personality, informants' interpersonal intimacy with the target is necessary for substantial increases in other-rating accuracy. Interpersonal intimacy improved accuracy especially for traits low in visibility (e.g., Emotional Stability) but only minimally for traits high in evaluativeness (e.g., Agreeableness). In addition, observer ratings were strong predictors of behaviors. When the criterion was academic achievement or job performance, other-ratings yielded predictive validities substantially greater than and incremental to self-ratings. These findings indicate that extraordinary value can gained by using other-reports to measure personality, and these findings provide guidelines toward enriching personality theory. Various subfields of psychology in which personality variables are systematically assessed and utilized in research and practice can benefit tremendously from use of others' ratings to measure personality variables.},

Drawing on a lexical approach to personality, the most commonly-used adjectives within narratives written by college students were identified using computerized text analytic tools. A factor analysis on the use of these adjectives in the self-descriptions produced a 7-factor solution consisting of psychologically meaningful dimensions. Some dimensions were unipolar (e.g., Negativity factor, wherein most loaded items were negatively valenced adjectives); others were dimensional in that semantically opposite words clustered together (e.g., Sociability factor, wherein terms such as shy, outgoing, reserved, and loud all loaded in the same direction). The factors exhibited modest reliability across different types of writ writing samples and were correlated with self-reports and behaviors consistent with the dimensions. Similar analyses with additional content words (adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and verbs) yielded additional psychological dimensions associated with physical appearance, school, relationships, etc. in which people contextualize their self-concepts. The results suggest that the meaning extraction method is a promising strategy that determines the dimensions along which people think about themselves.},

Adjusted for demographics, the 25th versus 75th percentile of SES was associated with an odds ratio of 1.43 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.11, 1.83). Demographic-adjusted odds ratios for the 75th versus 25th percentile of neuroticism were 1.38 (95\% CI: 1.10, 1.73) and 0.63 (95\% CI: 0.47, 0.84) for conscientiousness, the latter evaluated at high levels of agreeableness. Modest associations were observed between SES and the big 5. Adjusting each for the other revealed that personality explained roughly 20\% of the SES gradient in mortality, while SES explained 8\% of personality risk. Portions of SES and personality risk were explained by health behaviors, although some residual risk remained unexplained. Personality appears to explain some between-SES strata differences in mortality risk, as well as some individual risk heterogeneity within SES strata. Findings suggest that both sociostructural inequalities and individual disposition hold public health implications. Future research and prevention aimed at ameliorating SES health disparities may benefit from considering the risk clustering of social disadvantage and dispositional factors.},

However, mechanisms involved in these associations remain unknown. To distinguish between different mechanisms, we investigated whether specific risk factors of hypertension (physical inactivity, alcohol consumption, smoking, body mass index, waist circumference, and resting heart rate) intervene as mediators in the associations between individual or neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics and systolic blood pressure. We relied on data from the RECORD Cohort Study (Residential Environment and CORonary heart Disease) on 5941 participants recruited in 2007-2008, aged 30 to 79 years, residing in 1824 neighborhoods in the Paris metropolitan area. Systolic blood pressure increased independently and regularly with both decreasing individual education and decreasing residential neighborhood education. Body mass index/waist circumference and resting heart rate mediated an appreciable share of the associations between education and blood pressure and, adding validity to the finding, were the 2 most significant mediators for the effects of both individual education and neighborhood education. We found that 52\% (95\% CI: 25\% to 79\%) of the association between neighborhood education and blood pressure was mediated by body mass index/waist circumference and 20\% (95\% CI: 5\% to 36\%) by resting heart rate.

	abstract = {A central question in metaphor research is how metaphors establish mappings between concepts from different domains. The authors propose an evolutionary path based on structure-mapping theory. This hypothesis–the career of metaphor–postulates a shift in mode of mapping from comparison to categorization as metaphors are conventionalized. Moreover, as demonstrated by 3 experiments, this processing shift is reflected in the very language that people use to make figurative assertions. The career of metaphor hypothesis offers a unified theoretical framework that can resolve the debate between comparison and categorization models of metaphor. This account further suggests that whether metaphors are processed directly or indirectly, and whether they operate at the level of individual concepts or entire conceptual domains, will depend both on their degree of conventionality and on their linguistic form.},

The relation between Conscientiousness and BMI was significant in males and females, however, the magnitude of the negative association was stronger in females.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 7007 students entering the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill completed the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory during the mid-1960s. Of those students, 6958 had scores on the PSM scale and data for all-cause mortality through 2006. Scores on the PSM scale were evaluated as predictors of mortality using the Cox proportional hazards regression model, adjusted for sex. During the 40-year follow-up period, 476 deaths occurred. RESULTS: Pessimistic individuals who scored in the upper tertile of the distribution had decreased rates of longevity (hazard ratio, 1.42; 95\% confidence Interval, 1.13-1.77) compared with optimistic individuals who scored in the bottom tertile of the distribution. CONCLUSION: In a model that adjusted only for sex, a measure of optimistic vs pessimistic explanatory style was a significant predictor of survival during a 40-year follow-up period such that optimists had Increased longevity.},

Correlations between the word frequency indices and word difficulty ranks show that word frequencies for all four corpora are highly correlated wtih word difficulty. Despite these high correlations, the results show alos that the difficulty of some words is not estimated accurately by word frequency. The reasons for disparities between word frequency and word difficulty are not clear. The high correlations obtained for the corpus based on electronic text suggest that this method of sampling has potential, but that caution is advisable in conducting such collections.},

However, sexual satisfaction and relationship satisfaction wer found to change concurrently. The quality of intimate communication accounted for part of the concurrent changes in relationship satisfaction and sexual satisfaction.

	abstract = {Previous studies have identified the MMPI-based Cook and Medley hostility scale (Ho) as a predictor of health outcomes. To achieve a better understanding of the construct measured by this scale, Ho items were classified on an a priori basis. Six subsets were identified: Cynicism, Hostile Attributions, Hostile Affect, Aggressive Responding, Social Avoidance, and Other. Study 1 examined the correlations of these subsets with scales of the NEO Personality Inventory in two samples of undergraduates. Good convergent and discriminant validity were demonstrated, but there was some evidence that items in the Social Avoidance and Other categories reflect constructs other than hostility. Study 2 examined the ability of the Ho scale and the item subsets to predict the 1985 survival of 118 lawyers who had completed the MMPI in 1956 and 1957. As in previous studies, those with high scores had poorer survival (chi 2 = 6.37, p = 0.012). Unlike previous studies, the relation between Ho scores and survival was linear. Cynicism, Hostile Affect, and Aggressive Responding subsets were related to survival, whereas the other subsets were not. The sum of the three predictive subsets, with a chi 2 of 9.45 (p = 0.002), was a better predictor than the full Ho scale, suggesting that it may be possible to refine the scale and achieve an even more effective measure of those aspects of hostility that are deleterious to health.},

Exposure and reactivity to these minor stressors explained over 40\% of the distress difference between high- and low-neuroticism subjects. Reactivity to stressors accounted for twice as much of the distress difference as exposure to stressors.

Facial photographs of 24 male and 24 female stimulus persons were rated on babyishness, physical attractiveness, and several trait dimensions. Facial babyishness was positively correlated with appearance-based perceptions of physical and social weakness and approachability. The stimulus persons also completed several personality scales and rated their own facial babyishness and attractiveness. Relationships between objective and self-ratings of baby facedness and personality measures were revealed, and these paralleled impressions formed about the stimulus persons on the basis of facial appearance alone. Conditions under which a congruence between self and appearance-based perceptions are most likely to develop are discussed.},

	abstract = {We are currently pursuing methods for “author profiling” in which various aspects of the author’s identity might be identified from a text, without necessarily having a corpus of documents from the same individual. A key component of such an identity profile is personality; this paper addresses distinguishing high from low neuroticism and extraversion in authors of informal text. We consider four different sets of lexical features for this task: a standard function word list, conjunctive phrases, modality indicators, and appraisal adjectives and modifiers. SMO, a support vector machine learner, was used to learn linear separators for the high and low classes in each of the two tasks. We find that appraisal use is the best predictor for neuroticism, and that function words work best for extraversion. Further, examination of the specifically most important features yields insight into how neuroticism and extraversion differentially affect language use.},

Those whose trajectories were characterized by low symptoms were emotionally stable, educated, nonsmokers, and thin. Men with high, stable psychological trajectories had high hostility; those with low, stable trajectories had high emotional stability; those with moderate anxiety levels had nonlinear trajectories with peaks in psychological symptoms at different life stages.

Several classes of simple lexical and syntactic features that differ substantially according to author gender are identified, both in fiction and in non-fiction documents. In particular, we find significant differences between male- and female-authored documents in the use of pronouns and certain types of noun modifiers: although the total number of nominals used by male and female authors is virtually identical, females use many more pronouns and males use many more noun specifiers. More generally , it is found that even in formal writing, female writing exhibits greater usage of features identified by previous researchers as "involved" while male writing exhibits greater usage of features which have been identified as "informational". Finally, a strong correlation between the characteristics of male (female) writing and those of nonfiction (fiction) is demonstrated.},

Defining how quickly these impressions can be formed has critical implications for understanding social interactions and for determining the visual properties used to shape them. To study impression formation independent of emotional cues, threat judgments were made on faces with a neutral expression. Consequently, participants’ judgments pertained to the personality rather than to a certain temporary emotional state (e.g., anger). The results demonstrate that consistent first impressions can be formed very quickly, based on whatever information is available within the first 39 ms. First impressions were less consistent under these conditions when the judgments were about intelligence, suggesting that survivalrelated traits are judged more quickly. The authors propose that low spatial frequencies mediate this swift formation of threat judgments and provide evidence that supports this hypothesis.},

Although lesion and functional imaging studies in humans have demonstrated the amygdala's participation in recognizing emotional facial expressions, its role in human social behaviour has remained unclear. We report here our investigation into the hypothesis that the human amygdala is required for accurate social judgments of other individuals on the basis of their facial appearance. We asked three subjects with complete bilateral amygdala damage to judge faces of unfamiliar people with respect to two attributes important in real-life social encounters: approachability and trustworthiness. All three subjects judged unfamiliar individuals to be more approachable and more trustworthy than did control subjects. The impairment was most striking for faces to which normal subjects assign the most negative ratings: unapproachable and untrustworthy looking individuals. Additional investigations revealed that the impairment does not extend to judging verbal descriptions of people. The amygdala appears to be an important component of the neural systems that help retrieve socially relevant knowledge on the basis of facial appearance.},

	abstract = {This investigation provided a test of the gender-as-culture, or “two cultures,” hypothesis proposed by Maltz and Borker (1982) to explain male/female differences in language use. Analysis of previous empirical investigations located 16 language features that had consistently been shown to indicate communicator gender and these were tested within the framework of the four dimensions of intercultural style proposed by Gudykunst and Ting-Toomey (1988): direct versus indirect, succinct versus elaborate, personal versus contextual, and instrumental versus affective. Study 1 provided preliminary evidence supporting the hypothesized language-feature-by-dimension relationships (e.g., male directives were rated more direct and female uncertainty verbs more indirect). In Study 2, respondents rated multiple exemplars of the 16 language features, as well as 16 contrasting foil sentences, on all four dimensions, finding that nearly all of the variables fell on the hypothesized intercultural dimensions. In Study 3, respondents rated four sets of naturally occurring target sentences and matching foil sentences, representing all language variables, on their appropriate intercultural dimensions in order to establish dimensional polarity. Results across the three studies supported the hypothesized language feature-by-stylistic dimension relationships for 15 of the 16 variables: The 6 male language features were rated as more direct, succinct, personal, and instrumental, whereas 9 of the 10 female features were perceived as more indirect, elaborate, and affective. The findings demonstrate that gender preferences for language use function in ways that are consistent with stylistic preferences that distinguish national cultures.},

In addition, couples who exhibited relatively poor skills in both behavioral domains were at particular risk for later marital dysfunction.

When targets were photographed with a spontaneous pose and facial expression (spontaneous condition), observers' judgments were accurate for almost all of the traits examined. Lens model analyses demonstrated that both static cues (e.g., clothing style) and dynamic cues (e.g., facial expression, posture) offered valuable personality-relevant information.

Narratives were coded for the sophistication of meaning-making reported, the event type in the narrative, and the emotional tone of the narrative. Meaning-making was defined as connecting the turning point to some aspect of or understanding of oneself. Results showed that less sophisticated meaning was associated particularly with the less advanced diffusion and foreclosure statuses, and that more sophisticated meaning was associated with an overall identity maturity index. Meaning was also positively associated with generativity and optimism at age 23, with stories focused on mortality experiences, and with a redemptive story sequence. Meaning was negatively associated with achievement stories. Results are discussed in terms of the similarities and differences in the 2 approaches to identity development and the elaboration of meaning-making as an important component of narrative identity.},

Exploratory analyses revealed that a relative increase in dyadic interactions over the first 10 days after September 11 was marginally related to better psychological adjustment at follow-up. The findings have relevance for the understanding of stress and affiliation and normal psychological reactions to emergencies.},

Content analysis of the narrative data revealed that for both samples Neuroticism was positively associated with an emotionally negative life-narrative tone, Agreeableness was correlated with narrative themes of communion (e.g., friendship, caring for others), and Openness was strongly associated with the structural complexity of life narrative accounts. Contrary to prediction, however, Conscientiousness was not consistently associated with themes of agency (e.g., achievement, self-mastery) and Extraversion was unrelated to positive narrative tone. The results are discussed in the context of contemporary research and theorizing on the narrative study of lives and the relation of narrative research in personality to more conventional, trait-based approaches.},

Research on personal strivings and other motivational constructs provides a second perspective on personality, one that becomes psychologically salient in childhood with the consolidation of an agentic self and the articulation of more-or-less stable goals. Layered over traits and goals, internalized life stories begin to emerge in adolescence and young adulthood, as the person authors a narrative identity to make meaning out of life.

	abstract = {(from the chapter) This chapter brings together the best research being done in personality psychology today on personal narratives and the life story. A key concept in much of this work is narrative identity, which refers to an individual's internalized, evolving, and integrative story of the self. A growing number of theorists and researchers agree that people begin to construct narrative identities in adolescence and young adulthood and continue to work on these stories across the adult life course (Birren, Kenyon, Ruth, Shroots, \& Svendson, 1996; Cohler, 1982; Habermas \& Bluck, 2000; McAdams, 1985). The stories people fashion to make meaning out of their lives serve to situate them within the complex social ecology of modern adulthood. It is within the realm of narrative identity, therefore, that personality shows its most important and intricate relations to culture and society (McAdams, 2006; Rosenwald, 1992). Put differently, the stories we construct to make sense of our lives are fundamentally about our struggle to reconcile who we imagine we were, are, and might be in our heads and bodies with who we were, are, and might be in the social contexts of family, community, the workplace, ethnicity, religion, gender, social class, and culture writ large. The self comes to terms with society through narrative identity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved).},

	title = {Using linguistic cues for the automatic recognition of personality in conversation and text},
	volume = {30},
	abstract = {It is well known that utterances convey a great deal of information about the speaker in addition to their semantic content. One such type of information consists of cues to the speaker’s personality traits, the most fundamental dimension of variation between humans. Recent work explores the automatic detection of other types of pragmatic variation in text and conversation, such as emotion, deception, speaker charisma, dominance, point of view, subjectivity, opinion and sentiment. Personality affects these other aspects of linguistic production, and thus personality recognition may be useful for these tasks, in addition to many other potential applications. However, to date, there is little work on the automatic recognition of personality traits. This article reports experimental results for recognition of all Big Five personality traits, in both conversation and text, utilising both self and observer ratings of personality. While other work reports classification results, we experiment with classification, regression and ranking models. For each model, we analyse the effect of different feature sets on accuracy. Results show that for some traits, any type of statistical model performs significantly better than the baseline, but ranking models perform best overall. We also present an experiment suggesting that ranking models are more accurate than multi-class classifiers for modelling personality. In addition, recognition models trained on observed personality perform better than models trained using selfreports, and the optimal feature set depends on the personality trait. A qualitative analysis of the learned models confirms previous findings linking language and personality, while revealing many new linguistic markers.},

Twenty young adults were exposed to a physical stress causing great discomfort, specifically a cold wind (4 degrees C at 60 km/h) exposure to the face for 3 min. Autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses were measured by continuous heart rate and plasma catecholamine determinations before, during and after the test. At the end of the test, the participants gave a rating of discomfort on a 0 to 10 scale. The personality traits were assessed with the Big-Five Inventory test (BFI). Results indicated that higher levels of trait extraversion were positively correlated with discomfort ratings and with the increased heart rate and the noradrenaline responses. Neuroticism was negatively correlated to discomfort and the autonomic responses. These findings tend to support Eysenck's theory on the role of personality on arousal at higher levels of stress. It is also proposed that the better tolerance to this severe stress observed with neuroticism is correlated to a certain habituation process caused by light to moderate arousal frequently experienced by participants with this personality trait during their daily activities.},

Temperament models posit that the association is direct; instrumental models posit that the association is mediated by additional processes. Two experience sampling studies were conducted to test instrumental mechanisms that might underlie the effect. According to a mediation model, extraverts' greater social activity can account for their increased positive affect when compared to introverts. According to a person-by-situation interaction model, extraverts react more positively to social situations than do introverts, and this interaction can account for the association. Only weak support for the instrumental models was found; consistent with temperament models, a moderate direct association remained even after controlling for these effects.},

Optimism has been linked to enhanced well-being, whereas pessimism has been identified as a risk factor for poor physical health. This investigation examines prospectively the effects of optimism versus pessimism on pulmonary function. Data are from the Veterans Administration Normative Aging Study, an ongoing cohort of older men. In 1986, 670 men completed the revised Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory from which we derived the bipolar Revised Optimism-Pessimism Scale. During an average of 8 years of follow-up, an average of 3 pulmonary function exams were obtained. Men with a more optimistic explanatory style had significantly higher levels of forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (both p {\textless} .01). Interactions between time and optimism suggested that rate of decline in FEV1 over time was slower in men with a more optimistic explanatory style relative to men who were more pessimistic. These data are the first to link optimism with higher levels of pulmonary function and slower rate of pulmonary function decline in older men, a protective effect that is independent of smoking.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Personality is an important factor in determining longevity. It has been reported that some personality traits can affect mortality via health-related behaviors, engaging in social interactions, and a tendency to experience negative emotions. The authors examined the relationships between five major domains of personality traits and all-cause mortality among Japanese community-dwelling elderly. DESIGN: A 5-year prospective cohort study design with mortality surveillance. SETTING: Community based. PARTICIPANTS: A total sample of 486 men and 742 women aged 65 years and over at the baseline. MEASUREMENTS: The NEO five-factor inventory was administered to assess the "big five" personality traits: neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. RESULTS: During the 5-year follow-up period, 127 persons (73 men and 54 women) died. In Cox multivariate proportional hazards models adjusted for gender, age, number of years of education, living alone, presence of psychiatric problems, and presence of chronic diseases, conscientiousness (risk ratio RR = 0.50, 95\% confidence interval CI = 0.33-0.76 and RR = 0.46, 95\% CI = 0.29 to 0.71, for the middle and highest tertiles, respectively), extraversion (RR = 0.58, 95\% CI = 0.37 to 0.92, for the highest tertile), and openness (RR = 0.62, 95\% CI = 0.41 to 0.96, for the middle tertile) were independently and inversely associated with all-cause mortality. Neither neuroticism nor agreeableness was related to mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that out of the five domains of personality traits, conscientiousness, extraversion, and openness are reliable predictors of all-cause mortality among community-dwelling elderly.},

	abstract = {Previous relationship research has largely ignored the importance of similarity in how people talk with one another. Using natural language samples, we investigated whether similarity in dyads' use of function words, called language style matching (LSM), predicts outcomes for romantic relationships. In Study 1, greater LSM in transcripts of 40 speed dates predicted increased likelihood of mutual romantic interest (odds ratio = 3.05). Overall, 33.3\% of pairs with LSM above the median mutually desired future contact, compared with 9.1\% of pairs with LSM at or below the median. In Study 2, LSM in 86 couples' instant messages positively predicted relationship stability at a 3-month follow-up (odds ratio = 1.95). Specifically, 76.7\% of couples with LSM greater than the median were still dating at the follow-up, compared with 53.5\% of couples with LSM at or below the median. LSM appears to reflect implicit interpersonal processes central to romantic relationships.},

One domain of interest has been the relationships between individual differences in personality and the types of words that people use. The current study extends this research by examining the association between personality traits and language use in the production of self-narratives. Ninety-four undergraduate students were led through an automated writing program that facilitated the telling of the past and the planning of the future. Word usage was categorized using James Pennebaker’s Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) text-analysis software. Individual differences in the frequency of word use within these categories were correlated with measures of the Big Five personality traits. Every one of the Big Five was strongly and significantly associated with word use patterns theoretically appropriate to the trait, indicating strong connections between language use and personality.},

In a series of studies, we examined the constructs relevant to COPD patients' experience of health. First, we provided psychometric evidence that items in the BPQ form two distinct groups: functional problems and negative evaluations. Second, we showed that problems were significantly more correlated with morbidity whereas negative evaluations were significantly more correlated with neuroticism. Third, we showed that negative evaluations correlated with neuroticism whereas positive evaluations (measured by the Satisfaction with Illness Scale) correlated with extraversion. Patients are more likely to make positive evaluations of their illness when they recognize that they are seriously ill. Most of the BPQ domains are subcategories of the construct of problems: both domains and construct classifications provide useful information.},

As meaning can be conveyed either by the implicit, shared context or by the explicit form of the expression, the degree of context-dependence or “contextuality” of communication will vary, depending on the situation and preferences of the language producer. An empirical measure of this variation is proposed, the “formality” or “F-score”, based on the frequencies of different word classes. Nouns, adjectives, articles and prepositions are more frequent in low-context or “formal” types of expression; pronouns, adverbs, verbs and interjections are more frequent in high-context styles. This measure adequately distinguishes different genres of language production using data for Dutch, French, Italian, and English. Factor analyses applied to data in 7 different languages produce a similar factor as the most important one. Both the data and the theoretical model suggest that contextuality decreases when unambiguous understanding becomes more important or more difficult to achieve, when the separation in space, time or background between the interlocutors increases, and when the speaker is male, introverted and/or academically educated.},

Specifically, although husbands and wives who scored higher on a measure of neuroticism at the outset of marriage engaged in more IPV throughout the marriage on average, those who possessed more effective problem-solving skills or experienced lower levels of stress were significantly less likely to engage in IPV.

	volume = {15},
	abstract = {This study is an exploration of the long-term effects of parental divorce on a person's romantic relationships. Attachment theory (Bowlby, 1969a) suggests that parental divorce in itself may not cause poor romantic relationships, but rather, growing up with poor parent-child relationships and protracted interparental conflict may be what is most destructive to subsequent romantic relationships. Seventy-eight college students with divorced parents and a control group of 94 students from non-divorced households responded to a questionnaire assessing early experiences with parents and with any other individual besides a biological parent, called a `parent-substitute' who the subjects reported was `like a mother or father to them' while growing up (e.g. a stepparent, grandparent, older sibling, etc.). The questionnaire also assessed the perceived level of interparental conflict between the biological parents, and the subjects' current style of relating in romantic love relationships. A stepwise multiple regression was performed to clarify the effects of early parental relationships, interparental conflict and parent's marital status (divorce or married) using style of relating in romantic relationships as the criterion variable. Students who reported having accepting parents who encouraged their independence were most likely to report feeling secure in their current love relationships. Students who reported growing up with protracted interparental conflict, or rejecting, overprotective parents were most likely to report jealousy and fears of abandonment in their love relationships. Growing up with an accepting parent may increase an individual's resilience to possible negative effects of parental divorce. Additionally, this parent may not necessarily have to be a biological parent. Students from both non-divorced and divorced households who reported growing up with accepting parent-substitutes (e.g. step-parents, grandparents) were also likely to report feeling secure in their romantic love relationships.},

Standardising for R/A reduced the smoking/lung cancer association, virtually eliminated the smoking/other cancer and smoking/heart disease relationships and reduced the association of heart disease with blood cholesterol, blood sugar and hypertension.

Children's hostility and sociability, mediated by the development of prototypes (i.e., social images of children who smoke cigarettes) and subjective norms regarding smoking among peers, were expected to predict the development of their intentions to smoke cigarettes in the future. Children in 2nd through 5th grades (N = 809) from a western Oregon community participated in a longitudinal study. Hostility and sociability were assessed by teachers' ratings, and prototypes, subjective norms, and intentions were assessed by self-report at each of the first four annual assessments. Children's intentions to smoke predicted whether they had tried cigarettes by the fifth assessment. For both genders, latent growth modeling demonstrated that hostility, but not sociability, predicted the development of smoking intentions. Children who were more hostile were more likely to have higher initial levels of intentions to smoke, and for boys this effect was mediated by their higher initial levels of subjective norms about smoking. Sociability was not related to the development of smoking cognitions for boys or girls. These results are discussed in terms of opportunities to intervene in early influences on smoking intentions.},

	abstract = {Children's personality traits have enduring effects that shape adult well-being. In particular, childhood conscientiousness influences core aspects of adult well-being: health, friendships, and mastery. Research is now examining the mechanisms by which early personality traits initiate and sustain particular life paths. These include mediating and moderating mechanisms that may operate during critical developmental periods or may build cumulatively over time. Future research would benefit from testing theoretically derived mechanisms for different traits, and examining variables as they change over time, using both short- and long-term longitudinal designs over different life stages.},

Children in 1st through 5th grades (N=1,049) from a western Oregon community participated in a longitudinal study involving 4 annual assessments. Hostility and sociability were assessed by teachers' ratings at the 1st assessment, and attitudes, subjective norms, and intentions were assessed by self-report at all 4 assessments. For both genders, latent growth modeling demonstrated that sociability predicted an increase in intentions to use alcohol over time, whereas hostility predicted initial levels of these intentions. These personality effects were mediated by the development of attitudes and subjective norms, supporting a model wherein childhood personality traits exert their influence on the development of intentions to use alcohol through the development of these more proximal cognitions.},

An appealing explanation for this phenomenon is that writing facilities 'story-making' - the ability to make coherent and meaningful stories out of events in one's life - and it is forming a good story that promotes the health benefits. Despite the recent attention to this idea, the psychometrics and correlates of story-making are not known. The purpose of the current study was to explore this idea by measuring participants' story-making ability when writing about both emotional and unemotional topics and relate this to health, personality variables, and linguistic dimensions. Story-making was reliably assessed by independent raters, except for nonemotional topics. The ability to make good stories was not, however, consistent across topic, and story-making did not correlate with personality dimensions nor did it predict the health outcomes of patients.},

Multiple regressions identi ed generative concern as a predictor of the six well-being dimensions and of life satisfaction. A separate series of multiple regressions identi ed narrative themes of contamination, redemption, and affect tone as predictors of four of the well-being dimensions and of life satisfaction. Hierarchical regression analyses controlling for self-report measures showed contamination to be a signi cant predictor of environmental mastery, personal growth, and life satisfaction. Affect tone was a predictor of self-acceptance and life satisfaction. This pattern of results was not in uenced by the inclusion of demographic factors. Overall, the  ndings indicate the utility of combining narrative data with self-report data in investigating well-being at midlife.},

	abstract = {Environmental stressors may impact asthma morbidity through neuroimmunological mechanisms which are adversely impacted and/or buffered y social networks, social support, and psychological functioning. In addition, life stress may impact on health beliefs and behaviours that may affect asthma management. Whereas earlier psychosomatic models have supported a role for psychological stress in contributing to variable asthma morbidity among those with existing disease, a growing appreciation of the interactions between behavioural, neural, endocrine, and immune processes suggest a role for these psychosocial factors in the genesis of asthma as well. While a causal link between stress and asthma has not bee established, this review provides a framework in which we can begin to see links between these systems that might provide new insights to guide future explorations. The complexity of these interactions underscore the need for a multidisciplinary approach which combines the idea that the origin of asthma is purely psychogenic in nature with the antithetical consideration that the biological aspects are all important. These distinctions are artificial, and future research that synthesizes biological, psychological, sociocultural, and family parameters is urgently needed to further our understanding of the rising burden of asthma.},

Previous research suggests an asymmetry in the accuracy of personality judgments: Some aspects of personality are known better to the self than others and vice versa. According to the self-other knowledge asymmetry (SOKA) model presented here, the self should be more accurate than others for traits low in observability (e.g., neuroticism), whereas others should be more accurate than the self for traits high in evaluativeness (e.g., intellect). In the present study, 165 participants provided self-ratings and were rated by 4 friends and up to 4 strangers in a round-robin design. Participants then completed a battery of behavioral tests from which criterion measures were derived. Consistent with SOKA model predictions, the self was the best judge of neuroticism-related traits, friends were the best judges of intellect-related traits, and people of all perspectives were equally good at judging extraversion-related traits. The theoretical and practical value of articulating this asymmetry is discussed.},

Study 2 used an experimental paradigm to test the same hypothesis. Participants were randomly assigned to an ideal self-discrepancy salience condition or a control condition in which ideal self-discrepancies were not made salient. A significant interaction between self-discrepancy condition and neuroticism emerged such that the ideal self-discrepancy condition produced higher dejection-related affect relative to the control condition for people high in neuroticism compared to people low in neuroticism.},

Using this model, we generated novel faces with an increased range of trustworthiness and used these faces as stimuli in a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging study (study 2). Although participants did not engage in explicit evaluation of the faces, the amygdala response changed as a function of face trustworthiness. An area in the right amygdala showed a negative linear response—as the untrustworthiness of faces increased so did the amygdala response. Areas in the left and right putamen, the latter area extended into the anterior insula, showed a similar negative linear response. The response in the left amygdala was quadratic—strongest for faces on both extremes of the trustworthiness dimension. The medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus also showed a quadratic response, but their response was strongest to faces in the middle range of the trustworthiness dimension.},

Less is known about the longitudinal relation between personality and disease and whether chronic disease is associated with changes in personality. Method. Participants from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (N = 2,008) completed the Revised NEO Personality Inventory and a standard medical interview at regularly scheduled visits; the Charlson Comorbidity Index, a weighted sum of 19 serious diseases, was derived from this interview. Using data from 6,685 visits, we tested whether personality increased risk of disease and whether disease was associated with personality change. RESULTS: Measured concurrently, neuroticism and conscientiousness were associated with greater disease burden. The impulsiveness facet of neuroticism was the strongest predictor of developing disease across the follow-up period: For every standard deviation increase in impulsiveness, there was a 26\% increased risk of developing disease and a 36\% increased risk of getting more ill. Personality traits changed only modestly with disease: As participants developed chronic illnesses, they became more conservative (decreased openness). Discussion. This research indicates that personality traits confer risk for disease, in part, through health-risk behaviors. These traits, however, were relatively resistant to the effect of serious disease.},

	abstract = {The magnitude and variability of sex differences in vocational interests were examined in the present meta-analysis for Holland's (1959, 1997) categories (Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, and Conventional), Prediger's (1982) Things-People and Data-Ideas dimensions, and the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) interest areas. Technical manuals for 47 interest inventories were used, yielding 503,188 respondents. Results showed that men prefer working with things and women prefer working with people, producing a large effect size (d = 0.93) on the Things-People dimension. Men showed stronger Realistic (d = 0.84) and Investigative (d = 0.26) interests, and women showed stronger Artistic (d = -0.35), Social (d = -0.68), and Conventional (d = -0.33) interests. Sex differences favoring men were also found for more specific measures of engineering (d = 1.11), science (d = 0.36), and mathematics (d = 0.34) interests. Average effect sizes varied across interest inventories, ranging from 0.08 to 0.79. The quality of interest inventories, based on professional reputation, was not differentially related to the magnitude of sex differences. Moderators of the effect sizes included interest inventory item development strategy, scoring method, theoretical framework, and sample variables of age and cohort. Application of some item development strategies can substantially reduce sex differences. The present study suggests that interests may play a critical role in gendered occupational choices and gender disparity in the STEM fields.},

This longitudinal study investigated changes in the mean levels and rank order of the Big Five personality traits in a heterogeneous sample of 14,718 Germans across all of adulthood. Latent change and latent moderated regression models provided 4 main findings: First, age had a complex curvilinear influence on mean levels of personality. Second, the rank-order stability of Emotional Stability, Extraversion, Openness, and Agreeableness all followed an inverted U-shaped function, reaching a peak between the ages of 40 and 60 and decreasing afterward, whereas Conscientiousness showed a continuously increasing rank-order stability across adulthood. Third, personality predicted the occurrence of several objective major life events (selection effects) and changed in reaction to experiencing these events (socialization effects), suggesting that personality can change due to factors other than intrinsic maturation. Fourth, when events were clustered according to their valence, as is commonly done, effects of the environment on changes in personality were either overlooked or overgeneralized. In sum, our analyses show that personality changes throughout the life span, but with more pronounced changes in young and old ages, and that this change is partly attributable to social demands and experiences.},

	abstract = {Previous neuroimaging research has shown amygdala sensitivity to the perceived trustworthiness of neutral faces, with greater responses to untrustworthy compared with trustworthy faces. This observation is consistent with the common view that the amygdala encodes fear and is preferentially responsive to negative stimuli. However, some studies have shown greater amygdala activation to positive compared with neutral stimuli. The first goal of this study was to more fully characterize the amygdala response to face trustworthiness by modeling its activation with both linear and nonlinear predictors. Using fMRI, we report a nonmonotonic response profile, such that the amygdala responds strongest to highly trustworthy and highly untrustworthy faces. This finding complicates future attempts to make inferences about mental states based on activation in the amygdala. The second goal of the study was to test for modulatory effects of image spatial frequency filtering on the amygdala response. We predicted greater amygdala sensitivity to face trustworthiness for low spatial frequency images compared with high spatial frequency images. Instead, we found that both frequency ranges provided sufficient information for the amygdala to differentiate faces on trustworthiness. This finding is consistent with behavioral results and suggests that trustworthiness information may reach the amygdala through pathways carrying both coarse and fine resolution visual signals.},

We tested impressions of faces at full-frontal, three-quarter, and profile views. Judgments of personality (aggressiveness, competence, dominance, likeability, and trustworthiness) and physiognomy (attractiveness and facial maturity) were significantly correlated across full-frontal, three-quarter, and profile views of male faces. When under time pressure, with only a 50 ms exposure to each face, the correlations for profile with full-frontal and three-quarter view judgments of personality (but not physiognomy) dropped considerably. However, judgments of the full-frontal and three-quarter faces were significantly correlated across the self-paced and 50 ms viewing durations. These findings therefore show that perceptions of full faces lead to relatively similar interferences across both viewing angle and time.},

Pessimistic and anxious adults had higher BP levels and felt more negative and less positive than did optimists or low anxious adults throughout the monitoring. The few times that optimists did feel negative were associated with levels of BP as high as those observed among pessimists or anxious individuals, regardless of their mood. To the extent that trait anxiety measures neuroticism, these findings suggest that neuroticism is directly related to health indicators rather than simply to illness behavior. Furthermore, the results suggest that pessimism has broad physiological and psychological consequences.},

Although an analysis of all possible moderation effects was conducted, it was hypothesized that high extraversion (E) and conscientiousness (C) individuals would demonstrate significantly stronger relationships between intentions and exercise behavior than those low in E and C. Conversely, it was expected that high neuroticism (N) individuals would show a significantly weaker relationship between intention and exercise behavior than those low in N. A total of 300 undergraduate students completed measures of the FFM, TPB, and a 2-week follow-up of exercise behavior. Two-group structural equation models of the TPB were created using a median split for each personality trait. Overall, 5 significant (p {\textless} .05) moderating effects were found. Specifically, N was found to moderate the effect of subjective norm on intention. E also moderated the effects of subjective norm on intention as well as intention on behavior. C moderated the effects of affective attitude on intention and intention on behavior. Theorized influences for the presence or absence of personality moderators are discussed. The results generally support the possibility of personality being a moderator of the TPB but highlight the need for future research and replication.},

	abstract = {A leading theoretical model explaining informational and motivational influences on exercise behavior is the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Despite the relatively consistent performance of the TPB, over half of the variance remains unexplained in intention and behavior. One possibility for this unexplained variance may be underlying moderating effects that bias linear coefficients. The purpose of this study was to examine lower-order personality facet traits of neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness as moderators of the TPB. Hypotheses were generated based upon the specific personality traits and previous research, but all possible moderating effects were examined given the exploratory nature of the research. Participants were 298 undergraduate students (mean age= 19.97) who completed measures of the TPB, personality, and a two-week follow-up of exercise behavior. Results showed that two personality facets (i.e., industriousness-ambition, irritability) significantly (p {\textless} 0.01) moderated the relationship between the TPB and exercise behavior and two personality facets (i.e., insecurity, activity-adventurousness) significantly (p {\textless} 0.01) moderated the relationship between the TPB and intention. The moderating effects were small-to-moderate (e.g., 3-1\% additional explained variance). Theoretical and practical implications for exercise behavior were discussed.

Participants viewed 34 faces each for 100 ms or 30 s and rated their trustworthiness. Subsequently, participants were informed about the nature of the 2 groups and estimated group membership for each face. Judgments formed with extremely brief exposure were similar in accuracy and confidence to those formed after a long exposure. However, initial judgments of untrustworthy (criminals') faces were less accurate (M = 48.8\%) than were those of trustworthy faces (M = 62.7\%). Judgment accuracy was above chance for trustworthy targets only at Time 1 and slightly above chance for both target types at Time 2. Participants relied on perceived kindness and aggressiveness to inform their rapidly formed intuitive decisions. Thus, intuition plays a minor facilitative role in reading faces.},

Typically, there is a high degree of consensus in the attributions made to faces. Nevertheless, the extent to which such judgments are veridical is unclear and somewhat controversial. We have examined the relationship between self–report and perceived personality using both faces of individuals and computer graphic composites. Photographs were taken of 146 men and 148 women who each also completed a self–report personality questionnaire from which scores on the big five personality dimensions were derived. In study 1, we identified a relationship between self–reported extraversion and perceived extraversion in individual faces. For male faces alone, we also found some accuracy in the perception of emotional stability and openness to experience. In study 2, composite faces were made from individuals self–reporting high and low scores on each of the five dimensions. These composites were rated for personality and attractiveness by independent raters. Discriminant analyses indicated that, controlling for attractiveness, independent ratings on congruent personality dimensions were best able to discriminate between composite faces generated from individuals high or low on the self–report dimensions of agreeableness, extraversion, and, for male faces only, emotional stability.},

Experiment 3 analyzed the official transcripts of the Watergate tapes involving the dyadic interactions between President Richard Nixon and his aids H.R. Haldeman, John Erlichman, and John Dean. The results of the three studies offer substantial evidence that individuals in dyadic interactions exhibit linguistic style matching (LSM) on both the conversation level as well as on a turn-by-turn level. Furthermore, LSM is unrelated to ratings of the quality of the interaction by both participants and judges.

	abstract = {Ninety-six university students (48 males, 48 females) were randomly assigned a partner (whom they did not know well), forming two dyad conditions: (a) same-sex, and (b) mixed-sex. The 48 dyads were audiotape-recorded in 20-minute problem solving interactions, from which 300-word language samples were transcribed for analysis. In Study 1, 9 trained observers coded 12 language variables previously shown to distinguish male from female language use. Discriminant analysis results demonstrated that a weighted combination of 8 variables could differentiate male from female interactants: male indicators—interruptions, directives, and conjunctions/ fillers begin sentence; female indicators—questions, justifiers, intensive adverbs, personal pronouns, and adverbials begin sentence. An analysis of variance of individuals’ gender discriminant function scores showed greater differences in gender-linked language behavior in same-sex than in mixed-sex dyads. In Study 2, 231 naive observers rated the 96 interactants, using the Speech Dialect Attitudinal Scale. MANOVA results showed that in same-sex dyads, female interactants were rated higher on Socio-Intellectual Status and Aesthetic Quality, but no gender difference was found on Dynamism. However, in mixed-sex dyads, men were rated higher on Aesthetic Quality, whereas women were rated higher on Dynamism. Taken together, the analyses of the objective language data and the subjective attributional data provide partial support for the Gender-Linked Language Effect in same-sex dyads and for the attenuation of that effect in mixed-sex dyads.},

Blogs are increasingly used as a resource for academic study, as evidenced by this symposium. Bloggers are not, however, representative of the population as a whole: they are more likely to be teenage or 20-something females, and appear to be highly Open to Experience. Following our linguistic analysis of personal blog entries, we are constructing a feature set for the automatic detection of gender: a small-amount of n-gram context proves best at accounting for variance when compared to dictionary-based analysis.},

They use: more pronouns, adverbs and verbs; and fewer nouns, adjectives and prepositions. However, communication in a computer-mediated environment, such as e-mail, might disrupt these preferences. Also, other personality dimensions, such as Neuroticism, may be related to implicitness. The study exploited an existing corpus of e-mail texts written by native English speakers of known personality. Stratified corpus comparison used n-gram-based techniques from statistical natural language processing, to compare relative frequencies of use of (sequences of) parts-of-speech.

Using a bottom-up stratified corpus comparison, rather than the top-down content analysis techniques that have been used before, we examine a corpus of e-mail messages elicited from individuals of known personality, as measured by Eysenck’s EPQ-R instrument. This method allows us to isolate linguistic features associated with different personality types, via both word and part-of-speech n-gram analysis. We investigate the extent to which: Extraversion is associated with linguistic features involving positivity, sociability, complexity and implicitness; and Neuroticism with negativity, self-concern, emphasis, and implicitness. Numerous interesting features are uncovered. For instance, higher levels of Extraversion involve a preference for adjectives, while lower levels of Neuroticism involve a preference for adverbs. However, neither positivity nor negativity is as prominent as expected, and there is little evidence for implicitness.},

Consistent with earlier studies, patients tended to report less physician utilization than was recorded in the computerized provider records. However, they also tended to report slightly more emergency room visits than were reported in the computerized utilization records. There was no association between demographic or health variables and the tendency toward discrepancy between self-report and computerized utilization record reports. However, there was a tendency for the discrepancy to increase as the amount of record utilization increased. Thus, the likelihood of bias caused by differing demographic factors is low, but researchers should take into account that underreporting occurs and is likely to increase as utilization increases.},

Middle-aged adults often are responsible for guiding and caring for those younger and older in the family and workplace. Thus, the experience of generativity is a major focus of this period. There are a number of key changes and transitions that occur during this time, including menopause and adult children leaving home. Although the midlife crisis is commonly assumed to occur regularly in the middle years, research evidence suggests that it is not normative but tied to stable personality characteristics such as neuroticism. Although personality traits remain relatively stable, there are aspects of the self such as sense of control and gender role characteristics which may shift in the middle years. Lifestyle choices and health-promoting behaviors during the middle years can provide a preview of the quality of psychological and physical functioning during the later years of life.},

Better methods are needed for understanding the etiology of disorders, such as psychiatric syndromes, that presumably are the result of complex causal chains. METHOD: Approaches from psychology, epidemiology, clinical trials, and basic sciences were synthesized. RESULTS: The authors define conceptually and operationally five different clinically important ways in which two risk factors may work together to influence an outcome: as proxy, overlapping, and independent risk factors and as mediators and moderators. CONCLUSIONS: Classifying putative risk factors into these qualitatively different types can help identify high-risk individuals in need of preventive interventions and can help inform the content of such interventions. These methods may also help bridge the gaps between theory, the basic and clinical sciences, and clinical and policy applications and thus aid the search for early diagnoses and for highly effective preventive and treatment interventions.},

All subjects had diabetes for {\textgreater}1 year. Glycemic control was assessed by glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c).

Male subjects with type 1 diabetes reported fewer symptoms of bulimia and female subjects with type 1 diabetes reported greater body satisfaction than the normative group. A higher BMI was a significant predictor of greater body dissatisfaction, more so for female than male subjects. Symptoms of bulimia were associated with older adolescence and female sex. Those with more symptoms of bulimia were also more likely to have a higher BMI. Sex (female) and body dissatisfaction (more dissatisfied) predicted a stronger desire to be thin.

The association of alcoholism with depression is likely to be attributable to causal factors rather than a shared etiology, but the scarcity of information for other classes of substance use disorders precludes similar conclusions regarding their association with depression.

Results: Perceived impact of diabetes and supportive family and friends were prospectively predictive of participants' well-being measures. Although support from family and friends was predictive of better dietary self-care, this relationship was mediated by personal model beliefs. In particular, beliefs about the effectiveness of the diabetes treatment regimen to control diabetes was predictive of better dietary self-care. Conclusions: Both friends and family are important to support adolescents as they live with and manage their diabetes.

Common themes that appear within- and between- these categories are discussed, with consideration of ways in which theory may be advanced by future research.

Identification of the key constructs across different model types would allow coherent integration and promote further understanding of the psycho-social determinants of health behaviour.},

Main outcome measure: Eating disorders meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders(DSM-IV) criteria. Results: Eating disorders that met DSM-IV criteria were more prevalent in diabetic subjects (36, 10\%) than in non-diabetic controls (49, 4\%) (odds ratio 2.4, 95\% confidence interval 1.5 to 3.7; P{\textless}0.001).

Mean haemoglobin A1cconcentration was higher in diabetic subjects with an eating disorder (9.4\% (1.8)) than in those without (8.6\% (1.6)), P=0.04). Conclusions: DSM-IV and subthreshold eating disorders are almost twice as common in adolescent females with type 1 diabetes as in their non-diabetic peers.

	abstract = {Men in the United States suffer more severe chronic conditions, have higher death rates for all 15 leading causes of death, and die nearly 7 yr younger than women. Health-related beliefs and behaviours are important contributors to these differences. Men in the United States are more likely than women to adopt beliefs and behaviours that increase their risks, and are less likely to engage in behaviours that are linked with health and longevity. In an attempt to explain these differences, this paper proposes a relational theory of men's health from a social constructionist and feminist perspective. It suggests that health-related beliefs and behaviours, like other social practices that women and men engage in, are a means for demonstrating femininities and masculinities. In examining constructions of masculinity and health within a relational context, this theory proposes that health behaviours are used in daily interactions in the social structuring of gender and power. It further proposes that the social practices that undermine men's health are often signifiers of masculinity and instruments that men use in the negotiation of social power and status. This paper explores how factors such as ethnicity, economic status, educational level, sexual orientation and social context influence the kind of masculinity that men construct and contribute to differential health risks among men in the United States. It also examines how masculinity and health are constructed in relation to femininities and to institutional structures, such as the health care system. Finally, it explores how social and institutional structures help to sustain and reproduce men's health risks and the social construction of men as the stronger sex.},

The childhood personality traits evidenced robust, conceptually coherent relationships with adaptation, both concurrently and across time. Childhood personality added to the prediction of later adaptation, beyond childhood IQ and earlier adaptation in the same domain. Few sex differences were obtained in the relationships between childhood personality and adaptation.

According to the theory, social motives fall into 1 of 2 general categories–those related to the acquisition of knowledge and those related to the regulation of emotion. When time is perceived as open-ended, knowledge-related goals are prioritized. In contrast, when time is perceived as limited, emotional goals assume primacy. The inextricable association between time left in life and chronological age ensures age-related differences in social goals. Nonetheless, the authors show that the perception of time is malleable, and social goals change in 20–83 yr olds when time constraints are imposed. The authors argue that time perception is integral to human motivation and suggest potential implications for multiple subdisciplines and research interests in social, developmental, cultural, cognitive, and clinical psychology.},

A subsample kept diaries of all significant social interactions. After the initial correlation between personality and relationship quality was controlled for, Extraversion and its subfactors, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness predicted aspects of relationships such as number of peer relationships, conflict with peers, and falling in love. In contrast, relationship qualities did not predict personality traits, and changes in relationship qualities were unrelated to changes in personality traits.

These criteria build on earlier published clinical diagnostic guidelines for frontotemporal dementia produced by some of the workshop members. Results: The consensus criteria specify core and supportive features for each of the three prototypic clinical syndromes and provide broad inclusion and exclusion criteria for the generic entity of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. The criteria are presented in lists, and operational definitions for features are provided in the text. Conclusions: The criteria ought to provide the foundation for research work into the neuropsychology, neuropathology, genetics, molecular biology, and epidemiology of these important clinical disorders that account for a substantial proportion of cases of primary degenerative dementia occurring before the age of 65 years.},

The list of the units of analysis used by personality psychologists is wildly diverse. The apparent diversity of the units of analysis masks a unity underlying them and that this unity is captured by the term trait. Traits are consistent patterns of thoughts, feelings, or actions that distinguish people from one another. Traits seem to be required for science of personality because any science involves detecting and explaining consistent patterns. Trait follows three features: (1) traits can refer to thoughts, feelings, or behavior. Behavior depends on social contexts and that consistencies are an artifact of a person being in similar situations. This point is often overlooked by psychologists who define personality only in terms of consistent behaviors. (2) Trait ascription invariably involves comparison among people. (3) For traits to distinguish people from one another, they must display some distinctive consistency. Two forms of traits, discussed in this chapter, are outer traits and inner traits. Outer traits can be directly observed and inner traits that must be inferred.},

The five factors are assessed with a Dutch/Flemish adaptation of the NEO-PI-R (Costa \& McCrae, 1992) and the RIASEC types are assessed with the Self-Directed Search (Holland, 1977, 1979). The correspondence between both models is investigated using correlational and exploratory factor analysis. The results show that all Big Five domain factors are significantly related to at least one or more RIASEC types, but not all RIASEC scales are correlated with the Big Five. Especially the Realistic scale and to a lesser extent the Investigative scale are not represented in the Big Five. The findings of this study replicate and extend former findings by Costa, McCrae and Holland (1984) and Gottfredson, Jones and Holland (1993).

	doi = {10.1016/s0022-3476(97)70352-4},
	abstract = {Objectives: The goal of this study was to identify parental behaviors that relate to adherence and metabolic control in a population of young adolescents with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and to understand the interrelationships among the variables of parental involvement, adherence to blood glucose monitoring, and glycemic control. Study design: A cross-sectional design was used to investigate parental involvement in diabetes regimen tasks in 89 youth, aged 10 to l5 years, with IDDM. Levels of parental involvement in blood glucose monitoring (BGM) and insulin administration were evaluated through interviews. Assessment of adherence was made by physicians or nurses, independent of patient or parent reports of adherence. Glycemic control was assessed with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA lc ) (reference range, 4\% to 6\%). Results: There were significant differences in the mean HbA lc values between the older (13 to 15 years of age) (HbA lc = 8.9\% ± 1.03\%) and younger (10 to 12 years) patients (HbA lc = 8.4\% ± 1.06\%) ( p {\textless}0.02). Parental involvement in BGM was significantly related to adherence to BGM (number of blood sugar concentrations checked daily) in both groups of adolescent patients. The younger patients monitored their blood glucose levels more frequently than did the older patients, 39\% of the younger patients checked sugar concentrations four or more times daily compared with only 10\% of the older group ( p {\textless}0.007). In a multivariate model controlling for age, gender, Tanner staging, and duration of diabetes, the frequency of BGM was a significant predictor of glycemic control ( R 2 = 0.19, p {\textless}0.02). Increased frequency of BGM was associated with lower HbA 1c levels. When the frequency of BGM was zero or once a day, the mean HbA 1c level was 9.9\% ± 0.44 (SE); when the frequency of BGM was two or three times a day, the mean HbA 1c level was 8.7\% ± 0.17; and when the frequency of BGM was four or more times daily, the mean HbA 1c level was 8.3\% ± 0.22. Conclusions: Parental involvement in BGM supports more frequent BGM in 10- to 15-year-old patients with IDDM. This increased adherence to BGM is associated with better metabolic control (i.e., lower HbA 1c levels). These findings suggest that encouraging parental involvement in BGM with 10- to 15-year-old patients with IDDM may help to prevent the well-documented deterioration in glycemic control and adherence to treatment that often occurs in later adolescence.

Previous studies exploring the everyday problems of teenagers with diabetes have focused on adherence to self-care management, how self-determination affects metabolic control, and the perception of social support.ObjectiveThe aim of the study was to elucidate lived experiences, focusing on the transition towards autonomy in diabetes self-management among teenagers with type 1 diabetes.Design and methodData were collected using interviews, and a qualitative phenomenological approach was chosen for the analysis.ParticipantsThirty-two teenagers (18 females and 14 males) were interviewed about their individual experiences of self-management of diabetes.FindingsThe lived experiences of the transition towards autonomy in self-management were characterized by the over-riding theme “hovering between individual actions and support of others”. The findings indicate that individual self-reliance and confirmation of others are helpful in the transition process. Growth through individual self-reliance was viewed as a developmental process of making one's own decisions; psychological maturity enabled increased responsibility and freedom; motivation was related to wellbeing and how well the diabetes could be managed. The theme “confirmation of others” showed that parental encouragement increased the certainty of teenagers’ standpoints; peers’ acceptance of diabetes facilitated incorporation of daily self-management activities; support from the diabetes team strengthened teenagers’ self-esteem.ConclusionIn striving for autonomy, teenagers needed distance from others, but still to retain the support of others. A stable foundation for self-management includes having the knowledge required to practice diabetes management and handle different situations.},

	abstract = {Whereas cognitive deficits are known to be detectable long before the typical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are evident, previous studies have failed to determine when cognitive functioning actually begins to decline before dementia. Utilizing the long follow-up of the PAQUID study, we examined the emergence of the first clinical symptoms over a 14-year period of follow-up before the dementia phase of AD. This study relies on a case–control sample selected from the PAQUID cohort. Of the 3,777 initial subjects of the cohort, 350 subjects experienced development of AD during the 14 years of follow-up. The cases were matched to 350 elderly control subjects. The evolution of scores on cognitive, functional, and depression scales was described throughout the 14-year follow-up using a semiparametric extension of the mixed-effects linear model. The first decline in cognitive performances appeared as early as 12 years before dementia in measures of semantic memory and conceptual formation. Then, more global deficits appeared that were concomitant with an increase in memory complaints and depressive symptoms. About 2 years later, as a consequence of cognitive dysfunction, the subjects started to become slightly dependent in their activities of daily living. In the last 3 years, the impairment significantly worsened until the subjects reached the dementia phase. This approach, describing the 14 years preceding dementia, provides a clear illustration of the particularly long and progressive prodromal phase of AD, and shows the successive emergence of cognitive deficits, depressive symptoms, and functional impairment during this phase.

	abstract = {It is time to bury the old models of personality and health and replace them with theories and models that employ the most modern concepts from personality psychology. It has long been understood that some individuals are more prone to illness and premature mortality than are others. Indeed, assumptions about variations in disease proneness form part of the basis for clinical judgments by medical practitioners about their individual patients, the predictions of epidemiologists and insurance companies about health trends and costs, and much targeted preventive medical screening. Yet the extant models, both implicit and explicit, of the links between individual differences and health generally have relied on primitive and incomplete conceptions. Although some threats to a person's life and health are truly random, most of the threats to well-being are a function of various biopsychosocial characteristics of the individual. In principle, anyone may catch the flu or suffer a myocardial infarction, but individuals vary tremendously in the likelihood that they will achieve good health and longevity. That is, there is astonishing variation in whether one is vulnerable to various 770 diseases and whether one is likely to recover quickly from any diseases that take hold. A person does not contract the flu without exposure to an influenza virus, but persons vary tremendously as to whether they are exposed to the virus, whether they are infected after exposure, and how they respond to the illness if infected. In other words, understanding the likelihood of disease for the individual is often as important as knowing the general causes of disease. Much of this variation can be captured by a concept that encapsulates the biopsychosocial nature of the individual across time, namely the modern concept of personality.

In Study 1, the authors document the strength of laypeople's beliefs that the self is the best expert. In Study 2, the authors provide a direct test of self- and other-accuracy using an objective and representative behavioral criterion. To do this, the authors compared self- and other-ratings of daily behavior to real-life measures of act frequencies assessed unobtrusively over 4 days. Our results show that close others are as accurate as the self in predicting daily behavior. Furthermore, accuracy varies across behaviors for both the self and for others, and the two perspectives often independently predict behavior. These findings suggest that there is no single perspective from which a person is known best and that both the self and others possess unique insight into how a person typically behaves.},

Previous research regarding both meaning making processes and meanings made as determinants of adjustment has shown inconsistent effects, partly because of the lack of clearly articulated theoretical frameworks and problematic research strategies. In a 1-year longitudinal study, the authors distinguished the meaning making process from the outcomes of that process (meanings made), employing specific measures of both. The authors tested pathways through which meaning making efforts led to 3 different meanings made (growth, life meaning, and restored just-world belief) in a sample of 172 young to middle-age adult cancer survivors, and they explored whether those meanings made mediated the effect of meaning making efforts on psychological adjustment. Cross-sectional and longitudinal path models of the meaning making process indicate that meaning making efforts are related to better adjustment through the successful creation of adaptive meanings made from the cancer experience. The authors conclude with clinical implications and suggestions for future research.},

Although patients’ knowledge and self-management of diabetes may improve after camp, improved glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels have not been consistently demonstrated. Research Design and Methods: We performed a retrospective study of medical records at the Children’s Medical Center Dallas Endocrinology Center for adolescents with type 1 diabetes aged 12–18 yr. We compared patients who did (n = 77) or did not (n = 106) attend Camp Sweeney, a regional 20-d diabetes camp. Some patients (n = 82) and their parents also completed measures of adherence, depression, and quality of life. Results: HbA1c decreased over time in patients who attended diabetes camp \{mean [±standard deviation (SD)] at baseline, (T1) = 8.6\% (±1.8\%) and at follow-up, (T2) = 8.3\% (±1.6\%)\}, whereas it increased in those who did not attend [mean (±SD) at T1 = 8.4\% (±2.1\%) and at T2 = 8.9\% (±2.3\%)] (p {\textless} 0.005). Seven months after camp (T3), there were still significant differences in HbA1c between the camp and control groups (p = 0.04), with the difference because of persistent improvement for girls but not for boys. Patients’ adherence (p {\textless} 0.05) and adjustment (p {\textless} 0.05) improved by parental report in those who attended camp; parents of patients who did not attend did not report the change. Conclusions: Attending Camp Sweeney is associated with improved glycemic control and parent-reported adherence and adjustment in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Additional studies are needed to determine whether these findings can be generalized to other diabetes camps.},

EMA aims to minimize recall bias, maximize ecological validity, and allow study of microprocesses that influence behavior in real-world contexts. EMA studies assess particular events in subjects’ lives or assess subjects at periodic intervals, often by random time sampling, using technologies ranging from written diaries and telephones to electronic diaries and physiological sensors. We discuss the rationale for EMA, EMA designs, methodological and practical issues, and comparisons of EMA and recall data.

	abstract = {Background The value of continuous glucose monitoring in the management of type 1 diabetes mellitus has not been determined. Methods In a multicenter clinical trial, we randomly assigned 322 adults and children who were already receiving intensive therapy for type 1 diabetes to a group with continuous glucose monitoring or to a control group performing home monitoring with a blood glucose meter. All the patients were stratified into three groups according to age and had a glycated hemoglobin level of 7.0 to 10.0\%. The primary outcome was the change in the glycated hemoglobin level at 26 weeks. Results The changes in glycated hemoglobin levels in the two study groups varied markedly according to age group (P=0.003), with a significant difference among patients 25 years of age or older that favored the continuous-monitoring group (mean difference in change, −0.53\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI], −0.71 to −0.35; P{\textless}0.001). The between-group difference was not significant among those who were 15 to 24 years of age (mean difference, 0.08; 95\% CI, −0.17 to 0.33; P=0.52) or among those who were 8 to 14 years of age (mean difference, −0.13; 95\% CI, −0.38 to 0.11; P=0.29). Secondary glycated hemoglobin outcomes were better in the continuous-monitoring group than in the control group among the oldest and youngest patients but not among those who were 15 to 24 years of age. The use of continuous glucose monitoring averaged 6.0 or more days per week for 83\% of patients 25 years of age or older, 30\% of those 15 to 24 years of age, and 50\% of those 8 to 14 years of age. The rate of severe hypoglycemia was low and did not differ between the two study groups; however, the trial was not powered to detect such a difference. Conclusions Continuous glucose monitoring can be associated with improved glycemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes. Further work is needed to identify barriers to effectiveness of continuous monitoring in children and adolescents. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00406133.)},

Anxiety and depression are very common comorbidities in COPD and have significant impact on patients, their families, society, and the course of the disease.MethodsWe report the proceedings of a multidisciplinary workshop on anxiety and depression in COPD that aimed to shed light on the current understanding of these comorbidities, and outline unanswered questions and areas of future research needs.ResultsEstimates of prevalence of anxiety and depression in COPD vary widely but are generally higher than those reported in some other advanced chronic diseases. Untreated and undetected anxiety and depressive symptoms may increase physical disability, morbidity, and health-care utilization. Several patient, physician, and system barriers contribute to the underdiagnosis of these disorders in patients with COPD. While few published studies demonstrate that these disorders associated with COPD respond well to appropriate pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapy, only a small proportion of COPD patients with these disorders receive effective treatment.ConclusionFuture research is needed to address the impact, early detection, and management of anxiety and depression in COPD.},

We also examined whether friend support and negative relations with friends were related to health for both groups.MethodWe interviewed 127 adolescents with diabetes and 129 healthy adolescents on two occasions, separated by one year. We measured aspects of friendship and psychological health among both groups as well as self-care behavior and metabolic control among adolescents with diabetes. We used logistic regression analysis to predict the presence of friends, repeated measures analysis of covariance to predict changes in friendship over time, and hierarchical multiple regression analysis to examine the relations of friendship to psychological health, self-care behavior, and metabolic control.ResultsBoth groups of adolescents were equally likely to have a best friend and boyfriend/girlfriend, but healthy adolescents were more likely to have an other-gender friend. Adolescents with diabetes and healthy adolescents reported similar levels of friend support, but support increased over the year for healthy girls only. Boys with diabetes had the lowest levels of friend support. Negative relations with friends were inversely related to psychological health and predicted a decline in psychological health over time. Negative relations also predicted poor metabolic control and a deterioration of metabolic control over time.ConclusionThere are similarities and differences in the nature of friendship for adolescents with diabetes compared with healthy adolescents. Friendship serves a protective function for psychological health for both groups and has implications for physical health among those with diabetes.},

	abstract = {The purpose of the study was to examine the effect of different stressors on various domains of quality of life (QOL) in cancer patients. The study focused on testing a model describing interrelations between two kinds of stress antecedents, two mediating variables—perceived stress and self-efficacy—and QOL. The participants were 60 cancer patients of both genders and various diagnoses. They were administered questionnaires of background information, QOL, perceived stress and general self-efficacy. Two stress indices were defined empirically: health stress (based on advanced disease stage, long disease duration, and undergoing treatment) and social stress (based on unemployment, recent immigration, and older age). Confirmatory factor analysis enabled defining five factors of QOL. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that the index of social stress was related to more QOL scales than the index of health stress and very few interactions with the mediating variables. Structural equation modeling provided a more comprehensive and accurate view. It showed that the index of health stress affected QOL mainly through perceived stress, and that self-efficacy affected QOL by reducing perceived stress and increasing QOL. The major conclusions are that QOL is affected negatively by both health stresses and social stresses, but the former are mediated primarily by the experience of perceived stress.

Four general findings were obtained. First, personality development was characterized by substantive individual differences in change. Second, bivariate latent growth models indicated that individual differences in personality change were substantially associated with change in peer and family relationships. Third, forming a partner relationship for the first time moderated the maturation of personality. This finding was replicated over two subsequent time intervals with independent subgroups. Fourth, higher neuroticism and higher sociability predicted which of the singles began a partner relationship during the next 8 years. The results confirm that individual differences in personality development predict and result from life transitions and relationship experiences.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Two studies investigated whether situations are associated with the manifestation of Big Five trait contents in behavior. Several times per day for 2 or 5 weeks, participants reported their current Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Emotional Stability states and rated the concurrent situation on several characteristics. Multilevel models tested for the average individual's contingency of each Big Five state on each situation characteristic and for whether individuals differed from each other reliably in those contingencies. Results showed that (1) there are psychologically active characteristics of situations on which trait-manifesting behavior is contingent; (2) contingencies on psychologically active characteristics of varying situations are part of the explanation for the sizeable within-person variability in behavior; (3) individuals differ reliably in their contingencies, and such individual differences may partially explain individual differences in amount of variability; and (4) the situation characteristics that are psychologically active differ by trait. These findings suggest that within-person variability in personality states is meaningful and is related to situations, that personality psychology should characterize situations in terms of their relevance to personality states, and that process and individual-difference structure approaches can be integrated in personality psychology.},

	abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to test a life span health behavior model in which educational attainment and health behaviors (eating habits, smoking, and physical activity) were hypothesized as mechanisms to account for relations between teacher ratings of childhood personality traits and self-reported health status at midlife. Design: The model was tested on 1,054 members of the Hawaii Personality and Health cohort, which is a population-based cohort participating in a longitudinal study of personality and health spanning 40 years from childhood to midlife. Outcome: Childhood Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Intellect-Imagination influenced adult health status indirectly through educational attainment, healthy eating habits, and smoking. Several direct effects of childhood traits on health behaviors and health status were also observed. Conclusion: The model extends past associations found between personality traits and health behaviors or health status by identifying a life-course pathway based on the health behavior model through which early childhood traits influence adult health status. The additional direct effects of personality traits indicate that health behavior mechanisms may not provide a complete account of relations between personality and health.

It establishes that the specific situations that induce opportunity insights also affect the roles that individuals’ prior knowledge and learning approaches play for the formation of opportunity intentions. The likelihood of acting on their initial opportunity insights depends not only on how much prior knowledge individuals have of the opportunity domain, but also on whether their learning style matches the situation at hand. The results from an experiment show that domain–specific knowledge enables action when there is a person–situation match and impedes it when such a match is lacking.},

We interviewed both groups annually and had one parent complete a questionnaire. Results There were no group differences in depressive symptoms, anxiety, anger, or behavioral problems. However, adolescents with diabetes showed greater declines in social acceptance compared with healthy adolescents, and a greater rise in disturbed eating behavior. Over time, depressive symptoms and anxiety increased and self-worth decreased for females but not males; however, these differences were not qualified by group Conclusions Diabetes is not associated with indicators of psychological distress from early to middle adolescence, but may be associated with the emergence of social difficulties and eating disturbances.

Partial correlation and multiple regression have been utilized in previous studies, but a third approach is possible. Latent variable modeling combines the advantages of both these methods. Data from 345 healthy adults living in the UK enrolled in a longitudinal study of Internet users were used to illustrate this. Conscientiousness was extracted as a latent variable defined by its six facets. Health behaviors were modeled as a latent variable, defined by the Wellness Behaviors, Accident Control and Traffic Risk sub-scales of the Health Behavior Marker Scales (HBMS, Vickers, Conway \& Hervig, 1990). Given that the Self-discipline facet has been previously shown to contribute uniquely to health criteria, a direct pathway was modeled from Self-discipline to the HBMS (ß=.27). In addition to illustrating a ‘third approach’ to modeling facets, this study replicates and extends prior research by examining the associations between Conscientiousness and the HBMS in an Internet sample. The results strengthen claims by several commentators that measuring and modeling personality facets can help increase our understanding of how personality traits influence health behaviors.},

In addition, Openness to Experience was sometimes positively associated with scholastic achievement, whereas Extraversion was sometimes negatively related to the same criterion, although the empirical evidence regarding these latter two dimensions was somewhat mixed. Importantly, the literature indicates that the narrow personality traits or facets presumed to underlie the broad Big Five personality factors are generally stronger predictors of academic performance than are the Big Five personality factors themselves. Furthermore, personality predictors can account for variance in academic performance beyond that accounted for by measures of cognitive ability. A template for future research on this topic is proposed, which aims to improve the prediction of scholastic achievement by overcoming identifiable and easily correctable limitations of past studies.},

Overall, prosocial motivation is linked to (a) Agreeableness as a dimension of personality, (b) proximal prosocial cognition and motives, and (c) helping behavior across a range of situations and victims. In persons low in prosocial motivation, when costs of helping are high, efforts to induce empathy situationally can undermine prosocial behavior.},

In particular,p values are based on data that were never observed, and these hypothetical data are themselves influenced by subjective intentions. Moreover,p values do not quantify statistical evidence. This article reviews thesep value problems and illustrates each problem with concrete examples. The three problems are familiar to statisticians but may be new to psychologists. A practical solution to thesep value problems is to adopt a model selection perspective and use the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for statistical inference (Raftery, 1995). The BIC provides an approximation to a Bayesian hypothesis test, does not require the specification of priors, and can be easily calculated from SPSS output.},

Pragmatic factors include the lack of interest in mathematically precise thinking in psychology, inadequate representation of psychometric modeling in major statistics programs, and insufficient mathematical training in the psychological curriculum. Substantive factors relate to the absence of psychological theories that are sufficiently strong to motivate the structure of psychometric models.

This study explored the linguistic markers of differences in Internet self-presentation of self-identified pro-anorexics who defend anorexia as a lifestyle and self-identified anorexics in recovery.MethodOne hundred sixty-two Internet message board entries and 56 homepages originating from either pro-anorexics or recovering anorexics were analyzed for linguistic markers of emotional, cognitive, and social functioning, temporal focus, and anorexia-related psychological concerns.ResultsAcross both text sources, pro-anorexics displayed more positive emotions, less anxiety, a lower degree of cognitive reflection, and lower levels of self-directed attention than did recovering anorexics. Pro-anorexics were also more focused on the present and less on the past. Finally, pro-anorexics were more preoccupied with eating and less with school-related issues and death.ConclusionLinguistically, pro-anorexics and recovering anorexics engage in distinct psychological self-presentation styles. More research is needed to understand the clinical implications of these different linguistic styles.},

The evidence is strongest for negative affectivity/neuroticism, anger/hostility and related traits, and optimism. Models of mechanisms underlying these associations have emphasized physiological effects of stress, exposure to stressors, and health behavior. Preliminary evidence supports the viability of some mechanisms, but formal mediational tests are lacking. In addition to addressing limitations and inconsistencies in this literature, future research should address developmental aspects of these psychosocial risk factors, contextual moderators of their health effects, and intervention applications in the prevention and management of disease. In these efforts, greater incorporation of concepts and methods in the structural, social-cognitive, and interpersonal perspectives in the field of personality are needed.},

The study of personality characteristics in and of themselves within older adults is flourishing, and scholars are fruitfully using personality variables to predict important outcomes in older adulthood, particularly mortality. This chapter gives ample attention to the stability-change issue in personality, as well as the organization of personality variables and their utility in predicting mortality among older adults. We believe that conceptual and empirical work by developmentalists in these three areas (personality organization, personality development, and the personality-mortality association) has been particularly interesting since publication of the last volume of this handbook, justifying the selective focus on these three topics. We start with the issue of organization, then discuss stability and change, followed by a consideration of what may explain why some are stable and others not, and finally conclude with a treatment of the issue of personality and mortality in older adulthood.

Childhood personality traits were significantly associated with all 4 outcomes, and the effects were consistently larger for women than men. For men and women, childhood Conscientiousness was associated with less adult smoking and better adult self-rated health and, for women only, with lower adult BMI. Mediation analyses suggested that the effects of Conscientiousness on self-rated health were partially mediated by smoking and BMI. These findings add to the growing evidence that childhood personality traits predict adult health outcomes and are discussed in terms of future testing of the life span health-behavior model.

In order to investigate these questions, network data collection and analysis were integrated with more traditional questionnaire methodology and statistical analysis. The results show that the adolescents in the study were not creating more ties using SITs, nor were they necessarily creating weaker SIT-based ties; that there was little overlap between SIT-facilitated and offline social networks; and that socially isolated adolescents were less likely than other adolescents to use SITs.},

Eysenck, 1975) at 3 points spanning 11 years (participants were 18 years old at baseline). Hierarchical linear analyses showed that FH+ participants had higher levels of neuroticism and psychoticism over the study period, independent of AUD. Despite relatively large mean decreases in neuroticism (as well as extraversion), the magnitude of the between-groups differences found at age 18 were maintained over the next decade. These changes thus reflect stable underlying differences in personality and not artifacts of higher rates of AUDs in FH+ individuals, recently living in an alcoholic home, vulnerability to the developmental challenge of leaving home, and/or a developmental lag.},

Dietary intake was assessed with three 24-h recall interviews with each participant and one parent. Percentage of calories from protein, carbohydrates, and total fat; amount of each type of fat; and amount of cholesterol, fiber, and sugar were calculated as averages across 3 days. RESULTS—Adolescents with diabetes took in less total energy than recommended. The percentage of calories from carbohydrates and protein were within recommendations for adolescents with and without diabetes, but adolescents with diabetes exceeded the recommended fat intake. The diet of adolescents with diabetes consisted of a greater percentage of fat and protein and a smaller percentage of carbohydrates relative to adolescents without diabetes. Adolescents without diabetes consumed more sugar, while adolescents with diabetes took in more of all components of fat than adolescents without diabetes.

This model was tested in 2 random samples (1 of adults, 1 of adolescents) using a combination of moderated regression and path analysis corrected for measurement error. Results revealed strong support for the hypothesized model in both samples and indicate the importance of distinguishing psychological motives for alcohol use.

The underlying cognitive mechanism is assumed to function at both a concrete (symptom-based schemata) and abstract level (disease labels), and individuals often engage in biased testing while attempting to establish a coherent representation of a health threat. It also is postulated that cognitive and emotional processes form partially independent processing systems. The coherence of the system, or the common-sense integration of its parts, is seen as crucial for the maintenance of behavioral change.

Three intakes of occupational therapy students served as subjects who totalled 252 in all. Overall there were few significant correlations but those which emerged suggested introversion was related to academic performance in the first year and placement success in the third year. Various needs such as nurturance, achievement and understanding related in predictable ways to academic performance. Social anxiety was clearly related to absenteeism and self-monitoring to placement performance. These results are discussed in terms of the usefulness of personality assessment in selection.},

A normative sample (N= 207) of third to sixth graders was administered the Revised Class Play (RCP). Each received 3 scores (Sociability‐Leadership, Aggression‐Disruption, and Sensitivity‐Isolation). 7 years later, 88\% of these children and their parents participated in a questionnaire follow‐up study utilizing a broad range of adolescent outcome measures (e.g., social and athletic competence, academic performance, behavioral symptoms, well‐being). The 3 RCP scores were significantly related to both adolescent competence and psychopathology, supporting the predictive validity of the RCP as well as the continuity of general adaptation. Each dimension of peer reputation had a different pattern of prediction depending on the outcome criteria under consideration, suggesting the importance of a multidimensional approach to peer reputation. Positive peer reputation proved to be an important predictor of later adjustment. Sex differences were examined; results suggested somewhat different patterns of prediction for boys and girls, especially for the sensitive‐isolated dimension.},

Results indicate that self-report health measures reflect a pervasive mood disposition of negative affectivity (NA); self-report stress scales also contain a substantial NA component. However, although NA is correlated with health complaint scales, it is not strongly or consistently related to actual, long-term health status, and thus will act as a general nuisance factor in health research. Because self-report measures of stress and health both contain a significant NA component, correlations between such measures likely overestimate the true association between stress and health. Results demonstrate the importance of including different types of health measures in health psychology research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Threatening words were associated with greater skin conductance responses than were neutral words, but the groups did not differ in their electrodermal reactions to homophones. We take these findings as evidence that, although the different meanings of ambiguous stimuli may be processed in parallel by all subjects, an interpretive bias operates such that anxiety-prone individuals tend to become preferentially aware of the more threatening meaning of such events.},

In contrast, research relying on self-report measures of Type A and symptomatology find a consistent link between Type A behavior and a variety of minor illness and symptoms.

High-trait subjects alone tended to shift attention towards generally threatening material on both test occasions. Results for examination-related stimuli were more complex. Increased proximity to the examination was associated with an increase in attentional bias towards such threat stimuli in high-trait subjects, but with increased attentional avoidance of such stimuli in low-trait subjects. It is suggested that the attentional response to currently relevant stress-related stimuli may be associated with neither trait nor state anxiety alone, but with an interactive function involving both these variables.

As a contribution to an alleviation of this state of affairs, the conceptual overlaps and boundaries between general and education-specific concepts of emotion and anxiety, on the one hand, and motivation, on the other hand, are analyzed. On this basis a theoretical model of the interconnections between anxiety and motivation is developed.

Application of the family of perspectives associated with life-span developmental psychology is illustrated for the domain of intellectual development. Two recently emerging perspectives of the family of beliefs are given particular attention: The 1st suggests that plasticity can best be studied with a research strategy called testing-the-limits. The 2nd proffers that any developmental change includes the joint occurrence of gain (growth) and loss (decline) in adaptive capacity. To assess the pattern of positive (gains) and negative (losses) consequences resulting from development, it is necessary to know the criterion demands posed by the individual and the environment during the lifelong process of adaptation.},

I argue that this index is theoretically limited because it refers mainly to the average extremity of mood change and not the frequency of change and that time-series techniques be used to better represent emotional variability. The studies here illustrate how one class of time-series techniques—spectral analysis—can be applied to daily mood measures to index the frequency of mood shifts. The convergent validity of spectral estimates of mood change frequency is assessed relative to self-report and parental-report measures of emotional reactivity. The divergent validity of the spectral estimates of mood change frequency is assessed by examining their relation to the within-subjects standard deviation computed from daily mood assessments. Results suggest that the spectral approach provides an adequate index of mood change frequency that is independent of mood change extremity, helps clarify the meaning of emotional variability, and provides a new class of analytic strategies for inclusion in the idiographic-nomothetic paradigm.},

After establishing that only standard complete-data methods are needed to analyze a multiply-imputed set, the text evaluates procedures in general circumstances, outlining specific procedures for creating imputations in both the ignorable and nonignorable cases. Examples and exercises reinforce ideas, and the interplay of Bayesian and frequentist ideas presents a unified picture of modern statistics.},

Particular emphasis is paid to the hypothesis that individuals high in trait anxiety tend to approach threatening stimuli, whereas those low in trait anxiety tend to avoid such stimuli. The evidence indicates that there are such differences in the processing of threatening stimuli as a function of trait anxiety. However, these differences are found only under certain conditions, for example, when threatening and nonthreatening stimuli are presented concurrently, and when minor rather than major threat is involved. The differences between those high and low in trait anxiety encompass pre-attentive, attentional, and interpretative mechanisms. As a consequence, any adequate theory of trait anxiety must take proper account of cognitive mechanisms and functioning.},

Previous research has indicated that anxiety (Sarason, 1980) and explicitly set low expectations (Sherman, Skov, Hervitz, \& Stock, 1981) may lead to performance deficits in these situations. Experiment 1 indicates, in contrast, that with a strategy called defensive pessimism (Norem \& Cantor, 1986), individuals may sometimes use low expectations to cope with their anxiety so that it does not become debilitating. A second experiment further supports the contention that low expectations may help individuals negotiate risky situations by showing that interference with the defensive-pessimism strategy impairs performance. Subjects whose strategic construction of the situation was not interfered with do not show impaired performance. These data are interpreted as evidence that the effects of low expectations and high anxiety on performance may be mediated by the strategies individuals use when approaching risky situations.

In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias.

	abstract = {Purpose Cancer survivors are at increased risk for several comorbid conditions, and many seek lifestyle change to reduce dysfunction and improve long-term health. To better understand the impact of cancer on adult survivors' health and health behaviors, a review was conducted to determine (1) prevalent physical health conditions, (2) persistent lifestyle changes, and (3) outcomes of previous lifestyle interventions aimed at improving health within this population. Methods Relevant studies from 1966 and beyond were identified through MEDLINE and PubMed searches. Results Cancer survivors are at increased risk for progressive disease but also for second primaries, osteoporosis, obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and functional decline. To improve overall health, survivors frequently initiate diet, exercise, and other lifestyle changes after diagnosis. However, those who are male, older, and less educated are less likely to adopt these changes. There also is selective uptake of messages, as evidenced by findings that only 25\% to 42\% of survivors consume adequate amounts of fruits and vegetables, and approximately 70\% of breast and prostate cancer survivors are overweight or obese. Several behavioral interventions show promise for improving survivors' health-related outcomes. Oncologists can play a pivotal role in health promotion, yet only 20\% provide such guidance. Conclusion With 64\% of cancer patients surviving {\textgreater} 5 years beyond diagnosis, oncologists are challenged to expand their focus from acute care to managing the long-term health consequences of cancer. Although more research is needed, opportunities exist for oncologists to promote lifestyle changes that may improve the length and quality of life of their patients.},

Community dwelling individuals (n = 2,551) in the age range of 60–64 years were recruited randomly through the electoral roll. They were screened using the MMSE and a short cognitive battery, and those who screened positive underwent detailed medical and cognitive assessments. Extant MCI-related diagnoses were established by consensus. Predictive regression models on the sub-sample were used to determine population prevalence for the diagnoses. Of the 224 subjects who screened positive for MCI, 112 underwent a detailed assessment and 74\% met the criteria for at least one recognised diagnosis of mild cognitive deficit (MCI and related diagnoses). By predictive regression modelling, the prevalence of any MCI diagnosis was 13.7\% (95\% CI 9.1–30.2) in the population of 60- to 64-year-olds. The estimated prevalence rates for specific diagnoses were: MCI 3.7\%, ageing-associated cognitive decline 3.1\%, Clinical Dementia Rating score (0.5) 2.8\%, age-associated memory impairment 1\%, other cognitive disorders 0.9\%, and mild neurocognitive disorder 0.6\%. Agreement on ‘caseness’ between various proposed diagnoses was at best fair and generally poor. Memory and other cognitive problems not meeting the threshold for dementia are relatively common in 60- to 64-year-old individuals living in the community. The prevalence rate varies up to six-fold according to the diagnostic criteria applied, with limited overlap between diagnoses. There is an urgent need for standardization of the criteria.},

In 1997, women (n = 81) living in Worcester, Massachusetts, completed doubly labeled water measurements and wore an activity monitor for 14 days. They also completed seven interviewer-administered 24-hour physical activity recalls (PARs) and two different self-administered 7-day PARs. Measures of the personality traits “social desirability” and “social approval” were regressed on 1) the difference between physical activity energy expenditure estimated from doubly labeled water and each physical activity assessment instrument and 2) the difference between monitor-derived physical activity duration and each instrument. Social desirability was associated with overreporting of activity, resulting in overestimation of physical activity energy expenditure by 0.65 kcal/kg/day on the second 7-day PAR (95\% confidence interval: 0.06, 1.25) and overestimation of activity durations by 4.15–11.30 minutes/day (both 7-day PARs). Social approval was weakly associated with underestimation of physical activity on the 24-hour PAR (–0.15 kcal/kg/day, 95\% confidence interval: –0.30, 0.005). Body size was not associated with reporting bias in this study. The authors conclude that social desirability and social approval may influence self-reported physical activity on some survey instruments.},

Methods: A census was taken of a geographically defined urban community in Chicago, and those aged 65 years or older were invited to participate in an in-home interview; 6158 (79\% of those eligible) did so. The interview included brief measures of neuroticism and extraversion, medical history, and questions about current participation in cognitive, social, and physical activities. Vital status was subsequently monitored. The association of each trait with risk of death was examined in a series of accelerated failure-time models that controlled for age, sex, race, and education. Results: During a mean of more than 6 years of observation, 2430 persons (39.5\%) died. A high level of neuroticism (score = 27; 90th percentile) was associated with a 33\% increase in risk of death compared with a low level of neuroticism (score = 9; 10th percentile). A high level of extraversion (score = 33; 90th percentile) was associated with a 21\% decrease in risk of death compared with a low level (score = 18; 10th percentile). Adjustment for medical conditions and health-related variables did not substantially affect results, but adjusting for baseline levels of cognitive, social, and physical activity reduced the association of both traits with mortality. Conclusions: The results suggest that higher extraversion and lower neuroticism are associated with reduced risk of mortality in old age and that these associations are mediated in part by personality-related patterns of cognitive, social, and physical activity.

Motivation to manage her diabetes changed during the CAT sessions once her identity was confirmed as being separate from her diabetes. The client was then able to integrate diabetes into her life. Psychological and psychosocial factors are linked in complex ways, in both the personal development of adolescents with diabetes and their transition to adulthood. Understanding the impact of diabetes on identity can enhance the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions with nonadhering clients.},

The ways of appraising HIV revealed in this analysis have implications for interventions and for the study of coping with HIV as a chronic illness. The repeated assessment of specific HIV-associated stressful events and a qualitative analytic approach allowed for a more in-depth understanding of the meaning of HIV for the participants. This study suggests that coping interventions may be more powerful if they are tailored to individual appraisals of HIV because different forms of coping are likely to be differentially effective depending on the meaning of HIV in the individual's life.},

	abstract = {Many Aboriginal peoples are widely exposed to stress in their lives. This exposure to stress appears linked not only to their contemporary and immediate life circumstances (e.g., marginal economic and at-risk living conditions) but also to their historical, cultural, and political contexts. Recently, diabetes has become prevalent in many Aboriginal communities worldwide. The purpose of the present study was to gain a better understanding of the ways in which Aboriginal peoples with diabetes cope with stress. The study used a series of focus groups among First Nations and Métis women and men with diabetes in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Based on our cross-thematic analyses of the data, three overarching themes were identified: (1) individual and collective strengths of Aboriginal peoples with diabetes must be recognized and utilized to facilitate healing from or coping with the experience of stress and trauma; (2) healing must be accomplished holistically by maintaining balance or harmony among mind, body, and spirit; and (3) effective ways of coping with stress and healing from trauma potentially promote positive transformations for Aboriginal peoples and communities at both individual and collective levels. Also, sub-themes of stress-coping and healing that underlie and further describe the above three overarching themes emerged from the data. These include: (a) interdependence/connectedness, (b) spirituality/transcendence, (c) enculturation/facilitation of Aboriginal cultural identity, (d) self-control/self-determination/self-expression, and (e) the role of leisure as a means of coping with stress and healing from trauma. Accordingly, our deeper analyses resulted in the development of an emergent model of stress-coping and healing among Aboriginal peoples with diabetes, which is presented as a dynamic system in which the three overarching themes are embedded in the five specific themes of coping/healing. This evidence-based emergent model appears to provide some important insights into health policy and program planning for Aboriginal peoples with diabetes and their communities.},

We aimed to seek the views of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes and their parents regarding (i) the acceptability of the new programme and (ii) practical aspects regarding course design and delivery. Methods Twenty-four children and 29 parents attended one of eight separate focus groups. Semi-structured interview schedules were developed around two main areas of discussion: views on the education programme; and views on the design and delivery of current and future education. Discussions were tape-recorded and transcribed, before undergoing systematic qualitative analysis. Results Participants agreed that the proposed intervention was feasible, and were enthusiastic that it could improve quality of life and ‘normality’. Potential problems included self-management during school-time and parental anxiety. In terms of course design/delivery, participants emphasized the need to maximize enjoyment on the course (e.g. integrating fun and practical sessions, holding parts of the course outside of the clinic setting), and encourage effective learning and adherence to the regimen (e.g. including separate parent education, and using IT-based reference material). Conclusions The qualitative methodology proved an effective way of eliciting child and parent views and informing the development of the proposed intervention.

At the end of the study, patients in both groups used the CGMS for 3 days; these values were used to calculate measures of hypoglycemia. Repeated-measures analysis of variance with post hoc comparisons were used to test differences in hemoglobin A1c levels and hypoglycemia between the 2 study groups.RESULTSA total of 128 patients were enrolled in the study. Nineteen discontinued study participation, leaving 51 in the CGMS group and 58 in the SMBG group. No significant differences were noted in demographics or baseline characteristics between the 2 groups. There were no significant differences in hemoglobin A1c levels between the CGMS group and the SMBG group at baseline (9.1\%±1.1\% vs 9.0\%±1.0\%, P=.70), and both groups showed statistically significant (P{\textgreater}.001) and similar (P=.95) improvement in hemoglobin A1c levels after 12 weeks of study. However, the CGMS group had a significantly shorter duration of hypoglycemia (sensor glucose, ≤60 mg/dL) at week 12 of the study (49.4±40.8 vs 81.0±61.1 minutes per event, P=.009).CONCLUSIONUse of the CGMS to guide therapy adjustments in patients with insulin-treated diabetes reduces the duration of hypoglycemia compared with therapy adjustments guided by SMBG values alone.},

Furthermore, vigilance to pain was found to be associated with heightened pain severity. Finally, we found that neuroticism moderated the relationship between pain severity and catastrophic thinking about pain. The results strongly support the idea that vigilance to pain is dependent upon catastrophic thinking and pain-related fear.

Structural equation modelling identifies the Big Five personality factor scores account for between 22.7\% and 43.6\% of the variance across scores on the three approach to learning dimensions. Four of the Big Five personality factors and the three approach to learning dimensions were found to be poor predictors of academic performance. A linear regression analysis with academic performance as the dependent variable and age, prior educational attainment and conscientiousness as independent variables, accounted for 24.1\% of the variance in performance.

The mean age (±SD) was 14.9 ± 1.6 years, diabetes duration 7.1 ± 3.8 years, HbA1c 9.4 ± 1.6\%, and male-to-female ratio 52:51. RESULTS—There was a significant correlation between higher HbA1c values and higher degree of mental (r = 0.25, P {\textless} 0.05) and behavioral (r = 0.33, P {\textless} 0.01) disengagement and aggressive coping (r = 0.33, P {\textless} 0.01).

Greater use of active coping (P {\textless} 0.05) was significantly related to a decrease in HbA1c. Partial correlation analysis showed that lower scores on diabetes-specific quality of life were significantly related to greater use of emotion-focused coping (r = −0.22 to −0.49).

Peers were divided into two groups: fellow sufferers and peers without a chronic disease. At school, teachers, school nurses and classmates were part of the support network. Health care providers included nurses, physicians and physiotherapists. Technology was also part of the support network and included four techniques that may be used to communicate: computers, mobile telephones, television and videos. The results provided a useful insight into the social network of adolescents with chronic disease and serve to raise awareness of the problems and opinions experienced by adolescents with this condition.},

Main outcome measures Rating of factors influencing decisions on admission and response to eight hypothetical clinical scenarios. Results Of 381 doctors agreeing to participate, 232 (61\%) returned questionnaires. Most rated as important or very important the prognosis of the underlying disease (82\%) and of the acute illness (81\%) and the patients' wishes (71\%). Few considered the important socioeconomic circumstances of the patient (2\%), religious beliefs (3\%), and emotional state (6\%). In the vignettes, underlying disease (cancer versus non-cancerous disease) was not associated with admission to intensive care, but four other factors were: patients' wishes (odds ratio 3.0, 95\% confidence interval 2.0 to 4.6), upbeat personality (2.9, 1.9 to 4.4), younger age (1.5, 1.1 to 2.2), and a greater number of beds available in intensive care (1.8, 1.2 to 2.5). Conclusions Doctors' decisions to admit patients to intensive care are influenced by patients' wishes and ethically problematic non-medical factors such as a patient's personality or availability of beds.

	abstract = {Research from numerous corners of psychological inquiry suggests that self-assessments of skill and character are often flawed in substantive and systematic ways. We review empirical findings on the imperfect nature of self-assessment and discuss implications for three real-world domains: health, education, and the workplace. In general, people's self-views hold only a tenuous to modest relationship with their actual behavior and performance. The correlation between self-ratings of skill and actual performance in many domains is moderate to meager–indeed, at times, other people's predictions of a person's outcomes prove more accurate than that person's self -predictions. In addition, people overrate themselves. On average, people say that they are "above average" in skill (a conclusion that defies statistical possibility), over-estimate the likelihood that they will engage in desirable behaviors and achieve favorable outcomes, furnish overly optimistic estimates of when they will complete future projects, and reach judgments with too much confidence. Several psychological processes conspire to produce flawed self-assessments. Research focusing on health echoes these findings. People are unrealistically optimistic about their own health risks compared with those of other people. They also overestimate how distinctive their opinions and preferences (e.g., discomfort with alcohol) are among their peers–a misperception that can have a deleterious impact on their health. Unable to anticipate how they would respond to emotion-laden situations, they mispredict the preferences of patients when asked to step in and make treatment decisions for them. Guided by mistaken but seemingly plausible theories of health and disease, people misdiagnose themselves–a phenomenon that can have severe consequences for their health and longevity. Similarly, research in education finds that students ' assessments of their performance tend to agree only moderately with those of their teachers and mentors. Students seem largely unable to assess how well or poorly they have comprehended material they have just read. They also tend to be overconfident in newly learned skills, at times because the common educational practice of massed training appears to promote rapid acquisition of skill–as well as self-confidence–but not necessarily the retention of skill.Several interventions, however, can be introduced to prompt students to evaluate their skill and learning more accurately. In the workplace, flawed self-assessments arise all the way up the corporate ladder. Employees tend to overesti mate their skill, making it difficult to give meaningful feedback. CEOs also display overconfidence in their judgments, particularly when stepping into new markets or novel projects–for example, proposing acquisitions that hurt, rather then help, the price of their company's stock. We discuss several interventions aimed at circumventing the consequences of such flawed assessments; these include training people to routinely make cognitive repairs cor recting for biased self-assessments and requiring people to justify their decisions in front of their peers. The act of self-assessment is an intrinsically difficult task, and we enumerate several obstacles that prevent people from reaching truthful self-impressions. We also propose that researchers and practitioners should recognize self-assessment as a coherent and unified area of study spanning many subdisciplines of psychology and beyond. Finally, we suggest that policymakers and other people who makes real-world assessments should be wary of self-assessments of skill, expertise, and knowledge, and should consider ways of repairing self-assessments that may be flawed.},

They were asked to recall intake 1 year before diagnosis. Two years after the initial interview another food frequency questionnaire was completed recalling intake during the previous year. At the 2-year follow-up interview women were also asked if they had changed their intake of fruit, vegetables, and fat since diagnosis.Subjects/SettingTwo hundred sixty New Mexico women with newly diagnosed breast cancer between July 1997 and March 1999.AnalysisTwo-year change scores for kilocalories, macronutrients, and fruit and vegetable servings were calculated and tested for difference from zero using paired t tests or Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Subjects’ characteristics were related to change in kilocalories and linear regression was used to determine the relative importance of these characteristics. Amount of change in fruit and vegetable servings and fat intake were calculated using food frequency data for women who reported increasing their intake of fruits and vegetables or decreasing their intake of fat after diagnosis.ResultsSmall but significant decreases in intake of total energy and macronutrients were found 2 years postdiagnosis, with younger women reporting the greatest decreases. Fat as a percentage of diet increased over this period. There was no change in mean intake of fruit and vegetable servings. There is agreement between change as measured by food frequency questionnaire and change reported by more global questions on dietary habits; however, the amount of change measured was small. Women reporting an increase in fruit and vegetable intake postdiagnosis described an increase of one-quarter serving of fruit and one-third serving of vegetables per day.ConclusionsBreast cancer diagnosis results in modest dietary changes. Small changes in fruit and vegetable consumption suggest that efforts are needed to encourage increased consumption of these foods.},

Interest in quality of life in diabetic patients has lately increased. The Hvidore study group has recruited 2000 patients from several countries and has published an important paper whose conclusions suggest that T1DM patients have a better quality of life if they have a good metabolic control. The aim of this paper is to evaluate if summer camps, seen as an educational and therapeutic tool, can improve quality of life by increasing knowledge and self-management capacities. Certainly summer camps help T1DM children and adolescents to understand that they can be on vacations, practice sports, have fun with other children away from home and parents, just like every other child and adolescent. At summer camps T1DM patients become aware of not being the only ones to deal with the problem of diabetes; in addition parents become aware of their child's skills in the disease management and lastly improve the relationship with the medical staff who will have the opportunity of living an extremely important training experience. The more ambitious aim of summer camps, i.e. the gaining of knowledge and self-management skills and improvement in metabolic control, seems difficult to achieve. The limited literature available suggests that it is unlikely that one or more summer camps will contribute to the improvement of metabolic control; nevertheless, it is not easy to make such evaluations with scientific criteria. We think that Italian guidelines for summer camps should help in standardizing the organization and management; in this way it will be probably easier to evaluate the impact of summer camps on the quality of life.},

Academic performance was assessed throughout a three years period and via multiple criteria (e.g., exams and final-year project). In addition several indicators of academic behaviour, e.g., absenteeism, essay writing, tutors’ exam predictions, were also examined with regard to both academic performance and personality traits. In sample 1 (N=70), the Big Five personality factors (Costa \& McCrae, 1992)—particularly Neuroticism and Conscientiousness—were found to predict overall final exam marks over and above several academic predictors, accounting for more than 10\% of unique variance in overall exam marks. Results suggest that Neuroticism may impair academic performance, while Conscientiousness may lead to higher academic achievement. In sample 2 (N=75) the EPQ-R (Eysenck \& Eysenck, 1985) was used as the personality measure and results showed the three superfactors were the most powerful predictor of academic performance, accounting for nearly 17\% of unique variance in overall exam results. It is demonstrated that (like Neuroctisim) Psychoticism could limit academic success. The present results provide evidence supporting the inclusion of well-established personality measures in academic selection procedures, and run counter to the traditional view of ability measures as the exclusive psychometric correlate of academic performance.},

	abstract = {Patient centered palliative cancer care would imply, first, the introduction of psychosocial endpoints when evaluating treatment and making decisions. Second, patient control would have to be enhanced by information giving and increased decision involvement.We have indicated that paradoxes exist when a patient centered approach is advocated in the context of palliative cancer care. So-called patient oriented outcomes, like quality of life, once introduced seem to be disregarded by many patients themselves and survival is given a more important weight. Likewise, physicians seem to be inclined to treat patients aggressively for little benefit rather than providing supportive care. Both parties seem to prefer to do something actively to maintain a semblance of control over the disease process. Giving treatment, even if aggressive, is a way to avoid the confrontation with the little efficacy that the physician has to offer to incurable cancer patients.This mechanism is reflected in the content of conversations in palliative care. Patient centered care would imply that patient control and autonomy are enhanced. However, again paradoxically, many patients seem to want to avoid information and leave the decisions to be made by their doctors. Physicians, then, follow such wishes while paying more attention to aggressive therapy than to the notion of watchful waiting. This may help to avoid the painful confrontation with bad news.Dilemmas then remain. Patients wishing to maintain hope and avoid emotional impact of a full understanding of their prognosis may rather not be informed brusquely about prognosis or the aims of supportive therapy and forced to make an informed decision. However, by giving more aggressive, maybe even futile, treatment, and withholding supportive care patients may receive less than ‘quality end-of-life care’. Therefore, information about less intrusive strategies should still be given in a cautious manner, while regarding the patient’s defenses respectfully.},

In a sample of 683 university students, smoking, consumption of alcohol and drugs, and risky sexual behaviour were examined among eight types. Findings showed that several types deviated significantly from the average with respect to risky health behaviours. Types with a configuration of low conscientiousness and either high extraversion (Impulsives, Hedonists) or high neuroticism (Insecures) were particularly inclined to engage in multiple, risky health behaviours.

More than one fourth (27.4\%) of the sample scored greater than 16 on the Center for Epidemiological Studies- Depression Scale (CES-D), indicating a high risk of clinical depression. Depression was significantly associated with an increased likelihood of meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.) criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence (odds ratio = 5.2; 95\% confidence interval = 1.897–14.214). The level of depression was significantly correlated with poor medication (r = .301) and poor dietary compliance (r = .164). Both alcohol intake and illicit drug use were significantly correlated with poor dietary compliance (r = .195 and .185, respectively) and smoking (r = .190 and .269, respectively). Although no direct relationship between depression and the level of BP was substantiated by multivariate analysis, findings of descriptive analyses revealed statistically significant associations among depression, substance use, poor adherence, and poor BP outcomes. Given the harsh environment in which a large number of young urban Black men live, the high prevalence of substance abuse might be an attempt to fight off depression. Further in- depth investigation is needed to identify the role of depression and BP control in urban young Blacks in order to construct effective interventions that address their unique needs.},

Analysis Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio as a measure of the association of participant characteristics with lifestyle changes in the 12 months before the interview. Results Overall, 66.3\% of patients reported making lifestyle changes: 40.4\% made one or more dietary changes, 20.8\% added new physical activity, and 48.0\% started taking new dietary supplements. Compared with men, women were 2.2 times more likely to take new dietary supplements (P {\textless} .01). Compared with patients aged 35 to 59, those aged 60 to 69 and 70 or older were statistically significantly less likely to make dietary changes (odds ratio = 0.39 and 0.54, respectively) or to take new supplements (odds ratio = 0.42 and 0.69, respectively). Compared with patients who received only one medical treatment, those receiving three or more treatments were more likely to make dietary changes (odds ratio = 2.6) or to start new physical activity (odds ratio = 3.0). Patients diagnosed 12 to 24 months before the interview were as likely to report making lifestyle changes as those diagnosed within one year of the interview. Having a stronger desire for personal control or internal locus of control predicted use of new dietary supplements (P for trend {\textless} .05 for both). Applications/conclusions Cancer survivors are likely to be making lifestyle changes and represent a group that could benefit from counseling on diet and physical activity.

	abstract = {This article explores the impact of the temporal design, i.e. the sampling of times of measurement, on the statistical and substantive conclusions drawn from longitudinal biomedical and social science research. It is shown that for a study of a given duration, if observations are spaced too far apart the resulting data can support misleading conclusions, whereas if observations are spaced relatively close together, a much more veridical picture of the process of interest is provided. The application of these ideas in several areas is discussed, including correlation and regression analysis where a variable measured at one time is used to predict a variable measured at a later time; growth curve analyses; and analyses involving stage-sequential processes. We argue that longitudinal designs should relate the choice of timing and spacing of observations in longitudinal studies to characteristics of the processes being measured. In addition, consideration of the possible effects of measurement design on results of statistical analyses may aid in their interpretation. New approaches involving intensive data collection with much shorter measurement intervals, such as Ecological Momentary Assessment, are promising, but are costly and are not suitable for every research question. More information is needed to help guide researchers in their choice of temporal design.},

	abstract = {The extent of heterogeneity in a meta-analysis partly determines the difficulty in drawing overall conclusions. This extent may be measured by estimating a between-study variance, but interpretation is then specific to a particular treatment effect metric. A test for the existence of heterogeneity exists, but depends on the number of studies in the meta-analysis. We develop measures of the impact of heterogeneity on a meta-analysis, from mathematical criteria, that are independent of the number of studies and the treatment effect metric. We derive and propose three suitable statistics: H is the square root of the χ2 heterogeneity statistic divided by its degrees of freedom; R is the ratio of the standard error of the underlying mean from a random effects meta-analysis to the standard error of a fixed effect meta-analytic estimate, and I2 is a transformation of H that describes the proportion of total variation in study estimates that is due to heterogeneity. We discuss interpretation, interval estimates and other properties of these measures and examine them in five example data sets showing different amounts of heterogeneity. We conclude that H and I2, which can usually be calculated for published meta-analyses, are particularly useful summaries of the impact of heterogeneity. One or both should be presented in published meta-analyses in preference to the test for heterogeneity. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Blood glucose data were collected for up to 2.3 years by 128 children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. HbA1c values were date-matched with MBG levels calculated from an average of 85 self-monitored blood glucose measurements collected in the previous 30 days. There was significant linear correlation between MBG and HbA1c (HbA1c=0.027×MBG+5.8, n=682, r=.71, P{\textless}.0001) but also wide variability in the population HbA1c response to MBG. We calculated a hemoglobin glycation index (HGI=observed HbA1c−predicted HbA1c) to quantify the magnitude and direction of the difference between each patient's set of observed and predicted HbA1c results. Likelihood ratio tests and t statistics showed that mean HGI were significantly different among individuals, and that 29\% of the patients had HbA1c levels that were statistically significantly higher or lower than predicted by the regression equation. The observed individual differences in the relationship between MBG and HbA1c were not related to erythrocyte age and there was no evidence of analytical artifact. We interpret these results as possible evidence of high and low hemoglobin glycation phenotypes within the population. We conclude that MBG and HbA1c are not necessarily interchangeable estimates of glycemic control and that hemoglobin glycation phenotype may be important for the clinical assessment of diabetic patients.},

We argue that, not only can time series analysis elucidate specific maladaptive dynamics associated with psychopathology, it may also be clinically applied in symptom monitoring and the evaluation of therapeutic interventions.},

A total of 458 African American men were recruited primarily from US barbershops in the Western and Southern regions. The primary outcome was Barriers to Help-Seeking Scale (BHSS) scores. The hypothesized model was investigated with confirmatory factor and path analysis with tests for measurement invariance. Our model fit was excellent CFI = 0.99; TLI = 1.00; RMSEA = 0.00, and 90\% CI [0.00, 0.07] and operated equivalently across different age, income, and education strata. Frequent ERD and higher MNS contributed to higher BHHS scores. The relationship between ERD exposure and BHHS scores was partially mediated by diminished SOC and greater depressive symptomatology. Interventions aimed at addressing African American men's health help-seeking should not only address masculinity norms but also threats to sense of control, and negative psychological sequelae induced by everyday racism.},

The analyses were based on the Swedish Longitudinal Occupational Survey of Health, including 3706 working participants with repeat survey measures on four occasions (2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014). Psychosocial work characteristics including demands and social support were analyzed in relation to depressive symptoms. Autoregressive longitudinal mediation models using structural equation modeling were used to estimate the intermediate effects of unhealthy behaviors including current smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity. Both workplace demands and social support were related to later depressive symptoms. In bivariate models we found no significant paths from workplace demands to health behaviors, but two out of three significant time-specific paths from workplace support to excessive drinking and from excessive drinking to depressive symptoms. Social support was also associated with subsequent unhealthy diet, and one path from unhealthy diet to depressive symptoms was found. However, despite indications of certain longitudinal relationships between psychosocial working conditions and health behaviors as well as between health behaviors and depressive symptoms, no significant intermediate effects were found (p{\textgreater}0.05). We conclude that changes in unhealthy behaviors over a period of two years are unlikely to act as strong intermediaries in the longitudinal relationship between job demands and depressive symptoms and between social support and depressive symptoms.},

In a field study using more than 76,000 bank-transaction records, we found that individuals spend more on products that match their personality, and that people whose purchases better match their personality report higher levels of life satisfaction. This effect of psychological fit on happiness was stronger than the effect of individuals’ total income or the effect of their total spending. A follow-up study showed a causal effect: Personality-matched spending increased positive affect. In summary, when spending matches the buyer’s personality, it appears that money can indeed buy happiness.},

These features—dynamic processes, situational specificity, and individual heterogeneity—pose significant assessment challenges. In the current study, we demonstrate assessment and analytic methods that capture both between-person differences and within-person changes over time. Twenty-five participants diagnosed with BPD completed event-contingent, ambulatory assessment protocols over 21 days. We used p-technique factor analyses to identify person-specific psychological structures consistent with clinical theories of personality. Five exemplar cases are selected and presented in detail to showcase the potential utility of these methods. The presented cases’ factor structures reflect not only heterogeneity but also suggest points of convergence. The factors also demonstrated significant associations with important clinical targets (self-harm, interpersonal violence).},

We provide a broad overview of current analytic methods for quantifying relations among dyads using this data type. The techniques include those from within a linear modeling framework, approaches that include a measurement model, and methods for examining cyclical relations. We also discuss some special topics, such as methods that allow for models to shift across time and that accommodate heterogeneity across individuals. Finally, methods that account for similar shapes of nonlinear curves across time are described. From this breadth of options, we hope to help guide practitioners, clinicians, and researchers in choosing the optimal method for their data and line of questions. To further aid in this choice, we indicate programs available for each technique. Example dyads presented here range from mother–infant, patient–caretaker, and husband–wife; however, the analytic methods can be applied to any type of dyad.},

In a large nationally representative sample (N = 1,981 couples), a multilevel modeling procedure was employed to explore whether spousal life satisfaction contributes to self-health over and above the contribution of one’s own life satisfaction. Results: First, own happiness predicted better self-health and exercise (r values {\textgreater} .07), consistent with previous studies. Importantly, spousal happiness also uniquely predicted better self-health (r values {\textgreater} .06), above and beyond own happiness and critical covariates. Conclusions: This finding significantly broadens extant assumptions about the link between happiness and health, suggesting novel social mechanisms: simply having a happy partner may enhance health as much as striving to being happy oneself. Candidate pathways that could account for this unique boost are discussed.},

The adolescent’s quest for independence, balancing blood sugars, and integrating diabetes led to increased conflict with parents which contributed to difficulty coping. One code in this study, “figuring it out”, is the focus of this manuscript. Methods: Grounded theory with 15 in depth interviews were conducted with adolescents ages 11 to 15 with T1DM. Results: A theoretical model about the concept of “normalizing” was identified. Normalizing was defined as the ability to integrate diabetes into the background of one’s daily life to make diabetes ‘part of me’. The fifth phase of normalizing was “Figuring it out” which had 4 sub codes: (1) learning to accept diabetes, (2) believing it’s possible to manage their diabetes, (3) showing responsibility, and (4) staying on track, and the normalizing task was “accepting the new normal”. Conclusions: Adolescents with T1DM develop the understanding that diabetes is their ‘new normal’. The use of motivational interviewing, goal setting, and promotion of self-management may be important interventions in supporting adolescents with T1DM to normalize their life.},

PA level refers to the average level of positive feelings. In contrast, PA dynamics refer to short-term changes in PA that unfold over time. We discuss how consideration of both PA level and PA dynamics can provide a framework for reconciling when high PA is conducive or detrimental to health.

	abstract = {With rapid development of sensor technologies and the internet of things, research in the area of connected health is increasing in importance and complexity with wide-reaching impacts for public health. As data sources such as mobile (wearable) sensors get cheaper, smaller, and smarter, important research questions can be answered by combining information from multiple data sources. However, integration of multiple heterogeneous data streams often results in a dataset with several empty cells or missing values. The challenge is to use such sparsely populated integrated datasets without compromising model performance. Naïve approaches for dataset modification such as discarding observations or ad-hoc replacement of missing values often lead to misleading results. In this paper, we discuss and evaluate current best-practices for modeling such data with missing values and then propose an ensemble-learning based sparse-data modeling framework. We develop a predictive model using this framework and compare it with existing models using a study in a healthcare setting. Instead of generating a single score on variable/feature importance, our framework enables the user to understand the importance of a variable based on the existing data values and their localized impact on the outcome.},

	abstract = {Objective: Action planning can help translate physical activity intentions into action by linking situational cues with behavioral responses. Dyadic planning extends action planning and refers to target persons forming plans for their own behavior change together with partners. This study investigated whether a dyadic planning intervention could increase physical activity in target persons and their partners, whether these effects were moderated by relationship quality and mediated by action control, activity-specific received partner support, and control. Method: Couples (n = 338; target persons randomized) were randomly assigned to (a) a dyadic planning condition (DPC); (b) an individual planning condition (IPC), in which target persons planned and partners worked on a distractor task; or (c) a control condition (CC), in which couples worked on a distractor task. During 3 assessments up to 6 weeks postintervention, moderate (primary outcome) and vigorous activity were objectively measured; other variables were self-reported. Multilevel and path models were fit. Results: There were no beneficial direct effects of the intervention for DPC target persons. Over time, DPC partners’ vigorous activity increased, but decreased again. At lower relationship quality, DPC target persons’ activity decreased, whereas IPC target persons’ vigorous activity increased. Mediation hypotheses were not supported. Mutual influence models indicated positive effects of partners’ on target persons’ moderate activity in DPC and CC, whereas for IPC, negative effects of target persons’ on partners’ moderate activity emerged. Conclusions: Findings revealed the complexity of effects of dyadic planning on behavior change. Adding relationship quality to the equation clarified effects of DPC and IPC on physical activity.

This places a constraint on how often and for how long data can be collected due to the burden placed on human participants. Smartphones are ubiquitous and highly personal devices, equipped with sensors that offer an opportunity to measure and understand psychological processes in real-world contexts over the long term. In this article, we present a novel smartphone approach to address the limitations of self-report in bipolar disorder where mood and activity are key constructs. We describe the development of MoodRhythm, a smartphone application that incorporates existing self-report elements from interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, a clinically validated treatment, and combines them with novel inputs from smartphone sensors. We reflect on lessons learned in transitioning from an existing self-report instrument to one that involves smartphone sensors and discuss the potential impact of these changes on the future of psychological assessment.},

Electronic health records (EHRs) can be used in these settings to routinely collect a standardized set of social, psychological, and behavioral determinants of health. The expanded use of EHRs provides opportunities to improve individual and population health, and offers new ways for the psychological community to engage in health promotion and disease prevention efforts. This article addresses 3 issues. First, it discusses what led to current efforts to include measures of psychosocial and behavioral determinants of health in EHRs. Second, it presents recommendations of an Institute of Medicine committee regarding inclusion in EHRS of a panel of measures that meet a priori criteria. Third, it identifies new opportunities and challenges these recommendations present for psychologists in practice and research.},

Group iterative multiple model estimation (GIMME) combines the assets of the nomothetic and idiographic approaches by creating person-specific maps that contain a group-level structure. The maps show how intensively measured variables predict and are predicted by each other at different time scales. In this article, GIMME is introduced conceptually and mathematically, and then applied to an empirical data set containing the negative affect, detachment, disinhibition, and hostility composite ratings from the daily diaries of 25 individuals with personality pathology.

Continuing and expanding the scientific objectives of the Berlin Aging Study, the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II) seeks to comprehensively describe phenomena associated with aging and old age and to better understand the multiple different underlying factors and their interactions. To this end, BASE-II was established as a multi-institutional project combining and integrating interdisciplinary perspectives ranging from molecular genetics and immunology, geriatric medicine and psychology, to sociology and economics. In this Special Issue, we have compiled seven empirical analyses that feature examples of interdisciplinary insights that BASE-II provides by linking data across multiple levels of analyses at which human functioning and development occur in old age. Here, we provide an overview of the study, note commonalities between BASE-II and earlier studies, and highlight some of its unique qualities.},

In this article, we explain the rationale of the network approach, the associated methods and visualization, and illustrate it using an empirical example focusing on the relation between the daily fluctuations of emotions and neuroticism. The results suggest that individuals with high levels of neuroticism had a denser emotion network compared with their less neurotic peers. This effect is especially pronounced for the negative emotion network, which is in line with previous studies that found a denser network in depressed subjects than in healthy subjects.

The most popular measure of heterogeneity, I2, was derived under an assumption of homogeneity of the within-study variances, which is almost never true, and the alternative estimator, , uses the harmonic mean to estimate the average of the within-study variances, which may also lead to bias. This paper thus presents a new measure for quantifying the extent to which the variance of the pooled random-effects estimator is due to between-studies variation, , that overcomes the limitations of the previous approach. We show that this measure estimates the expected value of the proportion of total variance due to between-studies variation and we present its point and interval estimators. The performance of all three heterogeneity measures is evaluated in an extensive simulation study. A negative bias for was observed when the number of studies was very small and became negligible as the number of studies increased, while and I2 showed a tendency to overestimate the impact of heterogeneity. The coverage of confidence intervals based upon was good across different simulation scenarios but was substantially lower for and I2, especially for high values of heterogeneity and when a large number of studies were included in the meta-analysis. The proposed measure is implemented in a user-friendly function available for routine use in r and sas. will be useful in quantifying the magnitude of heterogeneity in meta-analysis and should supplement the p-value for the test of heterogeneity obtained from the Q test.

To answer this question, we conducted 2, 16-week intensive longitudinal randomized experiments. Across both studies, people who expressed goals to increase with respect to any Big Five personality trait at Time 1 tended to experience actual increases in their self-reports of that trait—as well as trait-relevant daily behavior—over the subsequent 16 weeks. Furthermore, we tested 2 randomized interventions designed to help participants attain desired trait changes. Although 1 of the interventions was inefficacious, a second intervention that trained participants to generate implementation intentions catalyzed their ability to attain trait changes. We also tested several theoretical processes through which volitional changes might occur. These studies suggest that people may be able to change their self-reported personality traits through volitional means, and represent a first step toward understanding the processes that enable people to do so.

The goal of this article was to investigate strategies for “waiting well” during these periods of uncertainty. Specifically, we propose 2 definitions of waiting well. First, people can wait in such a way as to ease their distress during the waiting period. Second, people could wait in such a way as to ease the pain of bad news or enhance the thrill of good news. We conducted a longitudinal study of law graduates (N = 230) awaiting their result on the California bar exam. Participants completed questionnaires prior to the exam, every 2 weeks during the 4-month waiting period, and shortly after learning whether they passed or failed. Cross-lagged models revealed that participants were quite unsuccessful at waiting well by our first definition. That is, their coping strategies were ineffective for reducing distress associated with uncertainty, apparently even backfiring in some cases. However, multiple regression analyses examining relationships between waiting experiences and responses to good and bad news found that many participants were successful at waiting well according to our second definition: Participants who suffered through a waiting period marked by anxiety, rumination, and pessimism responded more productively to bad news and more joyfully to good news, as compared with participants who suffered little during the wait. These findings substantiate the difficulty of enduring a stressful waiting period but suggest that this difficulty may pay off once the news arrives.},

	abstract = {The joint influence of persons and situations on behavior has long been posited by personality and social psychological theory (Funder, 2006; Lewin, 1951). However, a lack of tools for real-time behavioral and situation assessment has left direct investigations of this sort immobilized. This study combines recent advances in situation assessment and experience sampling methodology to examine the simultaneous effects of personality traits and situation characteristics on real-time expressions of behavior and emotion in N = 210 participants. The results support an additive model such that both personality traits and situation characteristics independently predict real-time expressions of behavior and emotion. These results have implications for several prominent theoretical perspectives in personality, including both trait and cognitive theories.},

A simulation study was conducted, varying function type, as well as the number of measurement occasions, in order to examine the effect of timing on the accuracy and efficiency of parameter estimates. The number of measurement occasions was associated with greater efficiency for all functional forms and was associated with greater accuracy for the intrinsically nonlinear functions. In general, concentrating measurement occasions toward the left or at the extremes was associated with increased efficiency when estimating the intercepts of intrinsically linear functions, and concentrating values where the curvature of the function was greatest generally resulted in the best recovery for intrinsically nonlinear functions. Results from this study can be used in conjunction with theory to improve the design of longitudinal research studies.

Our analysis uncovers correlations between different feature categories and income, some of which reflect common belief e.g. higher perceived education and intelligence indicates higher earnings, known differences e.g. gender and age differences, however, others show novel findings e.g. higher income users express more fear and anger, whereas lower income users express more of the time emotion and opinions.},

Subjects participated in a total of 36 hours in the clinic to contribute YSI reference glucose measurements with venous blood draws every 15 minutes on study Day 1, Day 4, and Day 7. The overall mean absolute relative difference (ARD) versus YSI was 13\% with a median of 10\%. Precision ARD was 9\% ± 4\% between 2 sensors with a 7\% coefficient of variation. The mean ARD versus SMBG was 14\% with a median of 11\%. One hundred two (94\%) sensors lasted 7 days and the systems displayed 97\% of their expected glucose readings in average. The time spent in low CGM readings during nighttime hours decreased from the first night use to the 6th night (P {\textless} .001) with a small difference in average CGM glucose from 147 ± 40 mg/dL to 166 ± 62 mg/dL. There were no serious adverse events or infectious complications reported. The study showed the Dexcom G4 Platinum CGM System is one of the most accurate CGMs. The significant reduction in nocturnal time spent in a hypoglycemic state observed during this study suggests that a longer term study of CGM use, especially nocturnal use, could be beneficial for patients with hypoglycemia unawareness.},

Little is known about who is mostly likely to show associations between cognitive complaints and preclinical Alzheimer pathology. We sought to demonstrate associations between subjective complaints and brain amyloid-β in cognitively normal older adults; and to explore personality factors as potential moderators of this association. Design Cross-sectional observational study. Setting Clinical neuroimaging research center. Participants Community volunteer sample of 92 healthy older adults, screened for normal cognition with comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation. Measurements Subjective cognitive self-report measures included the Memory Functioning Questionnaire (MFQ), Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, and the Subjective Cognitive Complaint Scale. Personality was measured with the NEO Five Factor Inventory. Brain amyloid-β deposition was assessed with Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET imaging. Results One of three cognitive complaint measures, the MFQ, was associated with global PiB retention (standardized beta = −0.230, p = 0.046, adjusting for age, sex and depressive symptoms). Neuroticism moderated this association such that only high neuroticism individuals showed the predicted pattern of high complaint–high amyloid-β association. Conclusion Evidence for association between subjective cognition and brain amyloid-β deposition in healthy older adults is demonstrable but measure-specific. Neuroticism may moderate the MFQ–amyloid-β association such that it is observed in the context of higher trait neuroticism. Subjective cognitive complaints and neuroticism may reflect a common susceptibility toward psychological distress and negative affect, which are in turn risk factors for cognitive decline in aging and incident Alzheimer disease.},

Instead, in line with a recent conceptualisation of health as “the ability to adapt and to self-manage”, we suggest that the centre point of a health psychology of ageing needs to be the stabilisation of health. Current theories of lifespan development, such as the model of selection, optimisation and compensation, the motivational theory of life span development, the two-process model of assimilative and accommodative coping and the recently introduced functional quality of life model are described with regard to their assumptions and related research focussing on stabilisation. All of these models explicitly comprise stabilisation as an important process of successful, healthy ageing. So far, however, the empirical research examining these models does not take stabilisation into account. Implications for research methods and practise of health stabilisation are discussed.},

	abstract = {Objective: The principal aim of this study was to examine the longitudinal interplay of depressive symptoms, diabetes-specific perceptions and distress, and glycemic control in emerging adults with Type 1 diabetes. Methods: Emerging adults with Type 1 diabetes (18–30 years old) participated in a 2-wave longitudinal study spanning 5 years (N = 164 at Time 1). Patients completed questionnaires on depressive symptoms, diabetes-specific distress (treatment-related, food-related, emotional, and social support problems), and illness perceptions (consequences and personal control) at baseline and follow-up. HbA1c values were obtained from treating clinicians. The authors investigated the directionality of effects using cross-lagged path analysis. Results: Stronger perceptions of control predicted a relative decrease in treatment-related problems 5 years later, whereas stronger perceptions of consequences predicted a relative increase in depressive symptoms, treatment-related, food-related, emotional, and social support problems over time. Furthermore, higher depressive symptoms predicted a relative increase in social support problems 5 years later. None of the study variables were related to changes in glycemic control over time. Conclusions: Our findings stress the importance of addressing patients’ perceptions and beliefs about their diabetes. Clinicians should find a delicate balance between stressing the importance of diabetes care and preventing patients from feeling overwhelmed or engulfed by the burden of diabetes care. Furthermore, our findings advocate for depression screening and treatment as key elements in holistic diabetes care, given the relatively high prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms in this population.},

Cross-sectional evidence has demonstrated that whereas all these disorders are characterized by high negative emotion, low positive emotion shows specificity in its associations with depressive disorders, social anxiety disorder, and possibly generalized anxiety disorder. However, it remains unknown whether low positive emotionality, a personality trait characterized by the tendency to experience low positive emotion over time, prospectively marks risk for the initial development of these disorders. We aimed to help address this gap. Each year for up to 10 waves, participants (n = 627, mean age = 17 years at baseline) completed self-report measures of mood and personality and a structured clinical interview. A latent trait-state decomposition technique was used to model positive emotionality and related personality traits over the first 3 years of the study. Survival analyses were used to test the prospective associations of low positive emotionality with first onsets of disorders over the subsequent 6-year follow-up among participants with no relevant disorder history. The results showed that low positive emotionality was a risk marker for depressive disorders, social anxiety disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder, although evidence for its specificity to these disorders versus the remaining anxiety disorders was inconclusive. Additional analyses revealed that the risk effects were largely accounted for by the overlap of low positive emotionality with neuroticism. The implications for understanding the role of positive emotionality in depressive disorders and anxiety disorders are discussed.},

The review is also intended to update findings from previous systematic reviews. Two databases (EBSCOHost and Scopus) were searched to retrieve empirical studies published up until 2013, with no lower time limit. All articles had to meet specific inclusion criteria, which resulted in 17 resilience measures selected for full review. Measures were conceptually evaluated against an interactionist framework and methodologically reviewed using Skinner’s (1981) validity evidence framework. We conclude that inconsistencies associated with the definition and operationalization of resilience warrant further conceptual development to explain resilience as a dynamic and interactive phenomenon. In particular, measures of resilience may benefit from a greater focus on within-person variance typically associated with behavioral consistency across situations. The use of alternative measurement modalities to self-report scales, such as situational judgment tests, is proposed as a way of advancing knowledge in this area.},

Fourteen years later, interviewers collected blood samples, as well as anthropometric and blood pressure measurements. Blood samples were analyzed for HbA1c.

The protective effects of close relationships were not significant for males, however.

	abstract = {Objective: Personality traits predict both health behaviors and mortality risk across the life course. However, there are few investigations that have examined these effects in a single study. Thus, there are limitations in assessing if health behaviors explain why personality predicts health and longevity. Method: Utilizing 14-year mortality data from a national sample of over 6,000 adults from the Midlife in the United States Study, we tested whether alcohol use, smoking behavior, and waist circumference mediated the personality–mortality association. Results: After adjusting for demographic variables, higher levels of Conscientiousness predicted a 13\% reduction in mortality risk over the follow-up. Structural equation models provided evidence that heavy drinking, smoking, and greater waist circumference significantly mediated the Conscientiousness–mortality association by 42\%. Conclusion: The current study provided empirical support for the health-behavior model of personality—Conscientiousness influences the behaviors persons engage in and these behaviors affect the likelihood of poor health outcomes. Findings highlight the usefulness of assessing mediation in a structural equation modeling framework when testing proportional hazards. In addition, the current findings add to the growing literature that personality traits can be used to identify those at risk for engaging in behaviors that deteriorate health and shorten the life span.

	abstract = {To investigate cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between personality and smoking, and test whether socio-demographic factors modify these associations. Cross-sectional and longitudinal individual-participant meta-analysis. Nine cohort studies from Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. A total of 79 757 men and women (mean age = 50.8 years). Personality traits of the five-factor model (extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness to experience) were used as exposures. Outcomes were current smoking status (current smoker, ex-smoker and never smoker), smoking initiation, smoking relapse and smoking cessation. Associations between personality and smoking were modelled using logistic and multinomial logistic regression, and study-specific findings were combined using random-effect meta-analysis. Current smoking was associated with higher extraversion [odds ratio per 1 standard deviation increase in the score: 1.16; 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.08–1.24], higher neuroticism (1.19; 95\% CI = 1.13–1.26) and lower conscientiousness (95\% CI = 0.88; 0.83–0.94). Among non-smokers, smoking initiation during the follow-up period was predicted prospectively by higher extraversion (1.22; 95\% CI = 1.04–1.43) and lower conscientiousness (0.80; 95\% CI = 0.68–0.93), whereas higher neuroticism (1.16; 95\% CI = 1.04–1.30) predicted smoking relapse among ex-smokers. Among smokers, smoking cessation was negatively associated with neuroticism (0.91; 95\% CI = 0.87–0.96). Socio-demographic variables did not appear to modify the associations between personality and smoking. Adult smokers have higher extraversion, higher neuroticism and lower conscientiousness personality scores than non-smokers. Initiation into smoking is associated positively with higher extraversion and lower conscientiousness, while relapse to smoking among ex-smokers is associated with higher neuroticism.},

We examined the associations between personality (self-reports and peer-reports) and friendship satisfaction (self-reports) among 434 students. We also examined whether role personality (how people act with their friends) and quantity and quality of social interactions using ecological momentary assessment mediate the associations between personality and friendship satisfaction. Extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and (low) neuroticism were associated with higher levels of friendship satisfaction. These associations could not be accounted for by individual differences in role personality. In addition, our results suggest that quantity of time spent with friends and quality of friend interactions (depth of conversation, self-disclosure and lack of emotion suppression), although associated with friendship satisfaction, do not account for the associations between trait personality and friendship satisfaction. Future research should examine other potential interpersonal processes that explain why some people are more satisfied with their friendships than others and the consequences of friendship satisfaction (e.g. for well-being).

In Study 1, participants were ambivalent as to whether awaiting or receiving bad news was more difficult, and emotion ratings in both studies confirmed this ambivalence. Anxiety was higher in anticipation of bad news (at least at the moment of truth) than in the face of it, whereas other negative emotions were more intense following the news than during the waiting period.

No significant differences were found in pain severity between the gender groups. Analyses indicated that women scored significantly higher for the personality trait of neuroticism than men (p {\textless} .05). Further analyses showed that different demographic, health, and personality variables predicted pain severity in women and men. Gender was found to be a significant moderator in the association between the personality trait of neuroticism and average pain. These findings suggest that both gender and different personality types may influence reported pain severity. Specifically, the results suggest that how patients experience and report pain severity may be gender-specific, and that it may be inappropriate to assume that women and men experience, report, and manage their pain in similar ways. Future studies focusing on the influence of personality and gender on health outcomes are needed to assist healthcare providers in tailoring treatment, thereby promoting optimal symptom management.},

The current daily diary study of 129 patients with type 2 diabetes examined whether individual differences in emotional stress reactivity were associated with fasting blood glucose and whether emotional support provided by spouses moderated this association. Greater stress reactivity was related to greater variability in patients’ fasting glucose readings and, among patients with less support, to higher fasting glucose levels. Investigating individual differences in emotional stress reactivity may help to clarify the role of stress in blood glucose control.},

Results Maternal education, but not income, was positively associated with child positive behaviors, displays of mother and child positive affect, and increased maternal responsiveness. Maternal positive affect and maternal responsiveness mediated the effect of maternal education on child positive affect.

This was in turn related to less effective self-control attempts. Second, initial self-control attempts also led participants to enact desires more frequently. This latter effect occurred even when (and perhaps especially when) those later desires were not resisted. In contrast, the strength model of self-control did not receive support, as initial self-control attempts did not affect the success of subsequent self-control attempts. These studies therefore suggest initial self-control does play an important role in producing later self-control lapses—just a different role than predicted by the strength model.},

The present study examined whether daily stress exposure and/or affective responses to daily stressors predicted mortality risk over a 20-year period. Based on the hypothesis that chronic illness confers vulnerability to deleterious effects of stress, we also examined whether its presence accentuated the association between daily stress processes and later mortality risk. Method: Participants were 1,346 middle-aged adults from the survey of Midlife Development in the United States who also completed the National Study of Daily Experiences. Participants reported on their experiences of stress and affect for 8 consecutive evenings, and mortality data were collected over the next 20 years, using the National Death Index and other methods. Results: There was a positive association between total number of stressors experienced across days and mortality risk. There was also a positive association between increases in negative affect on stressor days relative to nonstressor days and risk for mortality. The presence of a chronic illness moderated this association such that negative affective reactivity predicted mortality risk among individuals with at least one chronic illness but not among otherwise healthy individuals. This association was independent of sociodemographic characteristics, typical levels of negative affect on nonstressor days, and total number of endorsed stressors. Conclusion: These results suggest that greater increases in negative affect in response to stress in everyday life may have long-term consequences for longevity, particularly for individuals with chronic illness.},

However, different lines of research have emphasized either the role of genes or of environmental influences in shaping self‐esteem, and the pathways through which genes and environments exert their influence on self‐esteem remain largely unclear. In this study, we used nationally representative data from over 2000 German twin families and a nuclear twin family design (NTFD) to further our understanding of the genetic and environmental influences on individual differences in self‐esteem. Compared with classical twin designs, NTFDs allow for finer‐grained descriptions of the genetic and environmental influences on phenotypic variation, produce less biased estimates of those effects, and provide more information about different environmental influences and gene–environment correlation that contribute to siblings' similarity. Our NTFD results suggested that additive and non‐additive genetic influences contributed to individual differences in self‐esteem as well as environmental influences that are both shared and not shared by twins. The shared environmental component mostly reflected non‐parental influences. These findings highlight the increased sensitivity afforded by NTFDs but also remaining limitations that need to be addressed by future behavioural genetic work on the sources of self‐esteem.

The Hawaii study provides a unique opportunity to relate a comprehensive assessment of participants' childhood personality traits (over 2,000 children, mean age 10 years) to their adult personality traits and other self-report outcomes in their 40s, 50s, and 60s, and their clinically assessed health at mean age 51. Our analyses have demonstrated that the Big Five can be used to describe childhood personality in this cohort. The stability of the Big Five from childhood teacher assessments to adult self- or observer reports is modest and varies from Big Five trait to trait. Personality mechanisms of life span health behavior and life span trauma experience explain some of the influence of childhood Conscientiousness on adult health outcomes. A life span approach highlights the dynamic nature of traits and their long-term predictive utility, and it offers numerous directions for future research.},

Whether these motivational differences are also reflected in regulatory behavior and whether this behavior is efficient in terms of affect change, however, is unclear. To address these issues, we conducted 3 studies with samples ranging in age from adolescence to old adulthood. In Study 1, we developed a novel and age-fair music browsing paradigm for music of diverse musical styles, dates of origin, and affective characteristics. The time spent listening to self-selected music with varying levels of valence and arousal served as an indicator of affect-regulatory preferences in 2 different affectively relevant situations, namely after mood induction in Study 2 and before an upcoming discussion with a stranger in Study 3. As predicted, we found a higher preference for music with positive valence and low arousal in older as compared with younger individuals in both studies. Additionally, the efficacy of music listening as an affect-regulatory strategy was supported because individuals’ current affect significantly changed from before to after music listening (Studies 2 and 3), whereas that was not the case in an active control group listening to neutral nonmusical sounds (Study 3). These results extend previous research on affect regulation by demonstrating the utility of the music browsing paradigm as a behavioral indicator of affect-regulatory preferences in individuals from various age groups. They also provide evidence for age differences in, and affect-regulatory effects of, music-choice behavior.},

	abstract = {A scientist may publish tens or hundreds of papers over a career, but these contributions are not evenly spaced in time. Sixty years of studies on career productivity patterns in a variety of fields suggest an intuitive and universal pattern: Productivity tends to rise rapidly to an early peak and then gradually declines. Here, we test the universality of this conventional narrative by analyzing the structures of individual faculty productivity time series, constructed from over 200,000 publications and matched with hiring data for 2,453 tenure-track faculty in all 205 PhD-granting computer science departments in the United States and Canada. Unlike prior studies, which considered only some faculty or some institutions, or lacked common career reference points, here we combine a large bibliographic dataset with comprehensive information on career transitions that covers an entire field of study. We show that the conventional narrative confidently describes only one-fifth of faculty, regardless of department prestige or researcher gender, and the remaining four-fifths of faculty exhibit a rich diversity of productivity patterns. To explain this diversity, we introduce a simple model of productivity trajectories and explore correlations between its parameters and researcher covariates, showing that departmental prestige predicts overall individual productivity and the timing of the transition from first- to last-author publications. These results demonstrate the unpredictability of productivity over time and open the door for new efforts to understand how environmental and individual factors shape scientific productivity.},

Topics covered include the rationale behind the statistical control of third variables, common procedures for statistical control, and what can go wrong during their implementation. Certain types of third variables—colliders and mediators—should not be controlled for because that can actually move the estimate of an association away from the value of the causal effect of interest. More subtle variations of such harmful control include using unrepresentative samples, which can undermine the validity of causal conclusions, and statistically controlling for mediators. Drawing valid causal inferences on the basis of observational data is not a mechanistic procedure but rather always depends on assumptions that require domain knowledge and that can be more or less plausible. However, this caveat holds not only for research based on observational data, but for all empirical research endeavors.},

In late life, however, these trends seem to be reversed. Because many changes and transitions in older age are related to health, we investigated correlated changes in health problems and personality traits, the sources of health changes in later life and the directionality of effects. Our sample consisted of older adult twins, aged 64–85 years at time 1 (n = 410; 135 male/275 female; 134 monozygotic/63 dizygotic twin pairs), assessed at two different time points about five years apart, and we ran bivariate latent change and latent change twin model analyses. Increasing health problems were associated with decreases in agreeableness, extraversion, emotional stability and conscientiousness. Changes in health problems were only due to environmental influences, implying that the association between health and personality changes was exclusively environmental. Directional effects were largely absent, but health and personality were significantly related at the second measurement occasion (age 69–89 years). Our results support the link between health change and personality change in late life and spark the assumption of normative personality adaptations to deterioration of health status as a means of developmental regulation.

Study design An observational cohort study. Methods We evaluated social support using the Lubben Social Network Scale, across 624 adults aged over 60 years, and investigated this measure as a mediator of the relationships between extraversion and neuroticism at baseline 2007–2009, and cognitive function at follow-up, 2 years later. A half-longitudinal mediation design, within a structural equation modelling framework, was used. Results There was a direct effect of extraversion, such that lower levels were related to higher scores of cognitive function. There was no significant direct effect of neuroticism on cognitive function at follow-up. Social support partially mediated the paths between both extraversion and neuroticism and cognitive function at follow-up. Decomposing the mediation effects by using social support subscales (measuring support from friends, relatives and neighbours) showed meaningful indirect effects for both predictors. Conclusion Results suggest that social support may offer a target for interventions for cognitively at-risk older adults and add to the existing empirical evidence describing the link between personality and cognitive function.},

Research suggests acceptance, self-management, and stress, all factors that influence psychological flexibility, have an impact on adaptation to type 1 diabetes (T1D) by youth independently. However, yet to be explored is individually varying patterns of these variables and how they may relate to diabetes adaptation outcomes. The present study aimed to establish individual variations of patterns of these factors to derive profiles of psychological flexibility, and examine their relations to the adaptation outcomes of glycemic control and health-related quality of life. Youth (N = 162, aged 12-17 years) with T1D completed the Acceptance and Action Diabetes Questionnaire, Diabetes Stress Questionnaire, Self-Care Inventory, and Pediatric Quality of Life-Diabetes Module. Hemoglobin A1c values were abstracted from medical records. Latent profile analysis yielded three profiles: High Acceptance \& Adherence/Low Stress, Low Acceptance/Moderate Adherence \& Stress, and Low Acceptance \& Adherence/High Stress. The High Acceptance \& Adherence/Low Stress group displayed significantly higher health-related quality of life and lower HbA1c compared to other groups. Fluid psychological variables, such as acceptance and diabetes stress, and adherence behaviors may be salient targets to increase psychological flexibility for individual psychosocial interventions aimed at improving adaptation to type 1 diabetes in youth.},

Participants were drawn from a national prospective study (N = 13,882), the largest and most representative sample to date to test the association between personality and dementia. Participants completed a brief five factor model personality measure and their cognitive status was tracked for up to 8 years and classified into normal, cognitive impairment not dementia (CIND), and dementia groups. With Cox regression analyses we found that scoring lower on conscientiousness and higher on neuroticism was associated with increased risk of incident CIND and dementia (p {\textless} 0.001). Low agreeableness was also associated with dementia risk (p {\textless} 0.001). The association of personality with risk of dementia remained significant after adjusting for age, sex, education, race, ethnicity, smoking, physical activity, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cholesterol, HDL, Cystatin C, CRP, and Hemoglobin A1c. Among individuals with CIND at baseline, we found that conscientiousness was a significant predictor of conversion to dementia (p = 0.030), but there was only a non-significant trend for neuroticism. The meta-analysis of 7 prospective studies (N = 16,311) found consistent evidence that conscientiousness, neuroticism, agreeableness, and to a lesser extent openness, are associated with risk of dementia.},

	abstract = {Importance Changes in behavior and personality are 1 criterion for the diagnosis of dementia. It is unclear, however, whether such changes begin before the clinical onset of the disease. Objective To determine whether increases in neuroticism, declines in conscientiousness, and changes in other personality traits occur before the onset of mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Design, Setting, and Participants A cohort of 2046 community-dwelling older adults who volunteered to participate in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging were included. The study examined personality and clinical assessments obtained between 1980 and July 13, 2016, from participants with no cognitive impairment at first assessment who were followed up for as long as 36 years (mean [SD], 12.05 [9.54] years). The self-report personality scales were not considered during consensus diagnostic conferences. Main Outcomes and Measures Change in self-rated personality traits assessed in the preclinical phase of Alzheimer disease and other dementias with the Revised NEO Personality Inventory, a 240-item questionnaire that assesses 30 facets, 6 for each of the 5 major dimensions: neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Results Of the 2046 participants, 931 [45.5\%] were women; mean (SD) age at first assessment was 62.56 (14.63) years. During 24 569 person-years, mild cognitive impairment was diagnosed in 104 (5.1\%) individuals, and all-cause dementia was diagnosed in 255 (12.5\%) participants, including 194 (9.5\%) with Alzheimer disease. Multilevel modeling that accounted for age, sex, race, and educational level found significant differences on the intercept of several traits: individuals who developed dementia scored higher on neuroticism (β = 2.83; 95\% CI, 1.44 to 4.22; P {\textless} .001) and lower on conscientiousness (β = −3.34; 95\% CI, −4.93 to −1.75; P {\textless} .001) and extraversion (β = −1.74; 95\% CI, −3.23 to −0.25; P = .02). Change in personality (ie, slope), however, was not significantly different between the nonimpaired and the Alzheimer disease groups (eg, neuroticism: β = 0.00; 95\% CI, −0.08 to 0.08; P = .91; conscientiousness: β = −0.06; 95\% CI, −0.16 to 0.04; P = .24). Slopes for individuals who developed mild cognitive impairment (eg, neuroticism: β = 0.00; 95\% CI, −0.12 to 0.12; P = .98; conscientiousness: β = −0.09; 95\% CI, −0.23 to 0.05; P = .18) and all-cause dementia (eg, neuroticism: β = 0.02; 95\% CI, −0.06 to 0.10; P = .49; conscientiousness: β = −0.08; 95\% CI, −0.16 to 0.00; P = .07) were also similar to those for nonimpaired participants. Conclusions and Relevance No evidence for preclinical change in personality before the onset of mild cognitive impairment or dementia was identified. These findings provide evidence against the reverse causality hypothesis and strengthen evidence for personality traits as a risk factor for dementia.},

	abstract = {Consistently, research has demonstrated associations between dispositional traits and health outcomes, including mortality risk. One commonly reported mechanism is through health behavior, insofar that our personalities influence our tendencies to enact healthy lifestyles. However, a few critiques can be levied on the existing work. For instance, work is needed that provides greater specificity regarding the associations between personality and health behaviors, particularly with respect to how personality shapes one’s perceptions of the risks and benefits involved. Furthermore, research is needed to link personality to more intermediary health outcomes that may help understand when and why traits are associated with mortality risks. Finally, researchers typically have relied upon the Big Five trait taxonomy (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness to experience), which may fail to provide a comprehensive picture of how personality influences healthy aging. The current talks each address one or more of these concerns. First, Jackson and Weston provide a thorough examination of how personality traits influence older adults’ likelihood to adhere to their medication, focusing on how traits may impact adherence for different reasons. Second, Sutin and Terracciano investigate the linkage between conscientiousness and arterial health, an important intermediary, physiological health outcome when considering mortality risk. Third, Condon and colleagues present an alternative approach to considering personality and health risks, which improves on the predictive value provided by “only” investigating the Big Five. Finally, Lewis and Hill similarly move beyond the Big Five by considering purposefulness as a predictor of disease onset.},

	abstract = {Time series of individual subjects have become a common data type in psychological research. This is an exciting development because personalized models naturally tackle the issue of heterogeneities between people and increase the validity of models for applications. A popular model for time series is the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model, in which each variable is modeled as a linear function of all variables at previous time points. A key assumption of this model is that its parameters are constant (or stationary) across time. The most straightforward way to check for time-varying parameters is to fit a model that allows for time-varying parameters. In this paper we compare two methods to estimate time-varying VAR models: the first uses a spline-approach to allow for time-varying parameters, the second uses kernel-smoothing. We report the performance of both methods and their stationary counterparts in an extensive simulation study that reflects the situations typically encountered by applied researchers. We compare the performance of stationary and time-varying models, and discuss the theoretical characteristics of all methods in the light of the simulation results. In addition, we provide a step-by-step tutorial showing how to apply both methods to an openly available time series of mood measurements.},

Yet, religious nonbelief is often heavily stigmatized, potentially leading many atheists to refrain from outing themselves even in anonymous polls. We used the unmatched count technique and Bayesian estimation to indirectly estimate atheist prevalence in two nationally representative samples of 2,000 U.S. adults apiece. Widely cited telephone polls (e.g., Gallup, Pew) suggest U.S. atheist prevalence of only 3–11\%. In contrast, our most credible indirect estimate is 26\% (albeit with considerable estimate and method uncertainty). Our data and model predict that atheist prevalence exceeds 11\% with greater than .99 probability and exceeds 20\% with roughly .8 probability. Prevalence estimates of 11\% were even less credible than estimates of 40\%, and all intermediate estimates were more credible. Some popular theoretical approaches to religious cognition may require heavy revision to accommodate actual levels of religious disbelief.},

We then examine an ongoing study that includes several of the key design elements, the Rush Memory and Aging Project. In this longitudinal clinical-pathological cohort study, indicators of personality, social connectedness, and psychological well-being were shown to predict late-life cognitive outcomes. Participants who died underwent a uniform neuropathologic examination to quantify common dementia-related pathologies. Some psychosocial indicators were associated with cerebral infarction; some indicators modified the association of neurodegenerative pathologies with cognitive loss; and the association of some indicators with cognitive outcomes appears to be independent of the pathologies traditionally associated with late-life dementia. These findings suggest that psychosocial behavior influences late-life cognitive health through multiple neurobiologic mechanisms. A better understanding of these mechanisms may lead to novel strategies for preserving cognitive health in old age.},

The purpose of this study is to identify which specific aspects, or facets, of Conscientiousness are most protective against cognitive impairment and whether these associations are moderated by demographic factors and/or genetic risk. Health and Retirement Study participants were selected for analysis if they completed the facets of Conscientiousness measure, scored in the range of normal cognitive functioning at the baseline personality assessment, and had at least one follow-up assessment of cognition over the up to 6-year follow-up (N = 11 181). Cox regression was used to test for risk of incident dementia and risk of incident cognitive impairment not dementia (CIND). Over the follow-up, 278 participants developed dementia and 2186 participants developed CIND. The facet of responsibility had the strongest and most consistent association with dementia risk: every standard deviation increase in this facet was associated with a nearly 35\% decreased risk of dementia; self-control and industriousness were also protective. Associations were generally similar when controlling for clinical, behavioral, and genetic risk factors. These three facets were also independent predictors of decreased risk of CIND. The present research indicates that individuals who see themselves as responsible, able to control their behavior, and hard workers are less likely to develop CIND or dementia and that these associations persist after accounting for some common clinical, behavioral, and genetic risk factors.},

However, much of this research has been cross-sectional and has focused on broad, global personality traits. Less is known about how the components of personality traits (i.e., facets) affect changes in health and well-being over time in older couples. The current study applied actor-partner interdependence models to examine how conscientiousness and its facets moderated changes in health, health behavior, and well-being in older couples over a four-year period. Method: 3,271 older heterosexual couples (N=6,542 individuals; Mage=67.34, SD=8.59) from the Health and Retirement Study filled out a personality questionnaire at baseline. Measures of health (self-rated health, chronic illnesses), health behavior (light, moderate, and vigorous exercise), and well-being (depression) were assessed three times over a four-year period. Actor-partner interdependence models accounted for the non-independence of spouses and tested how partner conscientiousness affected health, health behavior, and well-being over time. Results: Actor conscientiousness, orderliness, and industriousness most reliably predicted better health, health behavior, and well-being. Partner conscientiousness predicted better self-rated health; partner orderliness and industriousness predicted better health and more positive health behavior. Many of these relationships persisted over the four-year study window. Discussion: The current study is the only of its kind to examine the dyadic effects of personality facets on health and well-being longitudinally. Results from the current study highlight the benefits of modeling dyadic processes within older couples and how these processes affect health and well-being over time.},

Thus, the current study explored cultural variation in empathy, and how this variation is related to psychological characteristics and prosocial behavior across cultures. Evidence from an original sample of 104,365 adults across 63 countries reveals that higher empathy countries also have higher levels of collectivism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, self-esteem, emotionality, subjective well-being, and prosocial behavior. These findings reveal that empathy is situated within a broader nomological network of other psychological characteristics, emotional expression and experiences, and prosocial behavior across cultures. The current study expands our understanding about how psychological characteristics vary across cultures and how these characteristics can manifest in broader national indicators of prosocial behavior.},

However, the extant literature is based largely on cross-sectional comparisons, which reflect a variety of influences and cannot directly represent change. We advocate using latent change score (LCS) models in longitudinal samples as a statistical framework to tease apart the complex processes underlying lifespan development in brain and behaviour using longitudinal data. LCS models provide a flexible framework that naturally accommodates key developmental questions as model parameters and can even be used, with some limitations, in cases with only two measurement occasions. We illustrate the use of LCS models with two empirical examples. In a lifespan cognitive training study (COGITO, N=204, two waves) we observe correlated change in brain and behaviour in the context of a high-intensity training intervention. In an adolescent development cohort (NSPN, N=176, two waves) we find greater variability in cortical thinning in males than in females. To facilitate the adoption of LCS by the developmental community, we provide analysis code that can be adapted by other researchers and basic primers in two freely available SEM software packages (lavaan and Ωnyx).},

One CGM device, with accuracy (\%MARD) of approximately 10\%, has recently been approved for self-adjustment of insulin dosages (nonadjuvant use) and approved for reimbursement for therapeutic use in the United States. CGM had previously been used off-label for that purpose. CGM has been demonstrated to be clinically useful in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes for patients receiving a wide variety of treatment regimens. CGM is beneficial for people using either multiple daily injections (MDI) or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). CGM is used both in retrospective (professional, masked) and real-time (personal, unmasked) modes: both approaches can be beneficial. When CGM is used to suspend insulin infusion when hypoglycemia is detected until glucose returns to a safe level (low-glucose suspend), there are benefits beyond sensor-augmented pump (SAP), with greater reduction in the risk of hypoglycemia. Predictive low-glucose suspend provides greater benefits in this regard. Closed-loop control with insulin provides further improvement in quality of glycemic control. A hybrid closed-loop system has recently been approved by the U.S. FDA. Closed-loop control using both insulin and glucagon can reduce risk of hypoglycemia even more. CGM facilitates rigorous evaluation of new forms of therapy, characterizing pharmacodynamics, assessing frequency and severity of hypo- and hyperglycemia, and characterizing several aspects of GV.},

Four findings stand out. First, the 1-year rank-order stability of personality traits was already substantial at age 12, increased strongly from early through middle adolescence, and remained rather stable during late adolescence and early adulthood. Second, we found linear mean-level increases in girls’ conscientiousness, in both genders’ agreeableness, and in boys’ openness. We also found temporal dips (i.e., U-shaped mean-level change) in boys’ conscientiousness and in girls’ emotional stability and extraversion. We did not find a mean-level change in boys’ emotional stability and extraversion, and we found an increase followed by a decrease in girls’ openness. Third, adolescents showed substantial individual differences in the degree and direction of personality trait changes, especially with respect to conscientiousness, extraversion, and emotional stability. Fourth, we found no evidence for personality trait convergence, for correlated change, or for time-lagged partner effects in dyadic friendship and sibling relationships. This lack of evidence for dyadic codevelopment suggests that adolescent friends and siblings tend to change independently from each other and that their shared experiences do not have uniform influences on their personality traits.},

	abstract = {Autoregressive and cross-lagged models have been widely used to understand the relationship between bivariate commensurate outcomes in social and behavioral sciences, but not much work has been carried out in modeling bivariate non-commensurate (e.g., mixed binary and continuous) outcomes simultaneously. We develop a likelihood-based methodology combining ordinary autoregressive and cross-lagged models with a shared subject-specific random effect in the mixed-model framework to model two correlated longitudinal non-commensurate outcomes. The estimates of the cross-lagged and the autoregressive effects from our model are shown to be consistent with smaller mean-squared error than the estimates from the univariate generalized linear models. Inclusion of the subject-specific random effects in the proposed model accounts for between-subject variability arising from the omitted and/or unobservable, but possibly explanatory, subject-level predictors. Our model is not restricted to the case with equal number of events per subject, and it can be extended to different types of bivariate outcomes. We apply our model to an ecological momentary assessment study with complex dependence and sampling data structures. Specifically, we study the dependence between the condom use and sexual satisfaction based on the data reported in a longitudinal study of sexually transmitted infections. We find negative cross-lagged effect between these two outcomes and positive autoregressive effect within each outcome. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In this review I provide a comprehensive conceptual account of these theoretical foundations, focusing on developing a principled intuition behind the method and its optimal implementations rather of any exhaustive rigor.

The GGM shows which variables predict one-another, allows for sparse modeling of covariance structures, and may highlight potential causal relationships between observed variables. We describe the utility in 3 kinds of psychological datasets: datasets in which consecutive cases are assumed independent (e.g., cross-sectional data), temporally ordered datasets (e.g., n = 1 time series), and a mixture of the 2 (e.g., n {\textgreater} 1 time series). In time-series analysis, the GGM can be used to model the residual structure of a vector-autoregression analysis (VAR), also termed graphical VAR. Two network models can then be obtained: a temporal network and a contemporaneous network. When analyzing data from multiple subjects, a GGM can also be formed on the covariance structure of stationary means—the between-subjects network. We discuss the interpretation of these models and propose estimation methods to obtain these networks, which we implement in the R packages graphicalVAR and mlVAR. The methods are showcased in two empirical examples, and simulation studies on these methods are included in the supplementary materials.},

The purpose of this study was to identify stressors of teens with Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and their parents related to the impending transition to adulthood. Design and Methods This study used open-ended questions to identify every day and illness-related stressors among 15 teens with T1DM and 25 parents seen in one pediatric diabetes clinic. Qualitative descriptive analysis identified themes in interview transcripts. Results The primary teen stressor related to impending transition centered on ineffective self-management, often when they were taking over responsibility for T1DM management. Parents' concerns included immediate and long-term negative outcomes of teen self-management as well as financial resources and health insurance for the teen. Teens and parents both expressed specific concerns about outcomes and prevention of nocturnal hypoglycemia, and identified uncertainties related to teen health and diabetes-focused health care when no longer living in the parent's home. Conclusions Teens with Type 1 diabetes and their parents understand that independent teen self-management is a component of transition to adulthood, but worry about teen self-management outcomes. Concerns specific to health care transition included health insurance, T1DM resources, and teens' abilities to handle new situations. Practice Implications Identifying current and future self-management concerns of individuals and families can facilitate targeted education and interventions to support successful transition to adulthood.},

	abstract = {Recent experimental work demonstrates that temporal distancing from negative experiences reduces distress. Yet two central questions remain: (a) do people differ in the habitual tendency to temporally distance from negative experiences, and if so (b) what implications does this tendency have for well-being? Seven studies explored these questions. Study 1 describes the construction and reliability of the Temporal Distancing Questionnaire, a new measure of individual differences in the tendency to place negative experiences into a broader future time perspective. Study 2 establishes a nomological network around this construct, examining the relationship of temporal distancing to other theoretically related constructs. Study 3 tests whether people high in temporal distancing (i.e., “high temporal distancers”) experience greater concurrent well-being, including greater positive affect and life satisfaction and lesser negative affect, worry, and depressive symptoms. Study 4 examines whether temporal distancing predicts well-being measured at the daily level, and across time. Finally, Studies 5a–5c explore a key way in which temporal distancing may support psychological well-being—by facilitating more adaptive responses to negative experiences. Our results demonstrate that the tendency to temporally distance from negative experiences predicts a more positive profile of affective experiences and stress-reactivity that may support immediate and longer-term well-being. Moreover, many of these findings remained significant when controlling for general reappraisal tendencies.},

Although different empirical studies separately examined patients' preferences for self-management support (SMS), an overview is lacking.

Qualitative studies were identified from Embase, MEDLINE OvidSP, Web of science, PubMed publisher, Cochrane central, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and PsycINFO. Articles needed to meet all of the following criteria: (i) focuses on self-management, (ii) concerns adult patients with rheumatic diseases (rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia), a variant of cancer or chronic kidney disease, (iii) explores support needs from the patients' perspective, (iv) uses qualitative methods and (v) published in English. A thematic synthesis, developed by Thomas and Harden, was conducted of the 37 included studies. Chronic patients need instrumental support, psychosocial support and relational support from health-care professionals, family/friends and fellow patients to manage the chronic condition. Relational support is at the centre of the support needs and fuels all other types of support. Patients do not self-manage on their own. Patients expect health-care professionals to fulfil a comprehensive role. Support needs can be knitted together only when patients and professionals work together on the basis of collaborative partnership. Dynamics in support needs make it important to regularly assess patient needs.},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the meaning, popularity, and content advisory warnings related to ambiguous NSSI hashtags on Instagram.MethodsThis study used the search term “\#selfharmmm” to identify public Instagram posts. Hashtag terms co-listed with \#selfharmmm on each post were evaluated for inclusion criteria; selected hashtags were then assessed using a structured evaluation for meaning and consistency. We also investigated the total number of Instagram search hits for each hashtag at two time points and determined whether the hashtag prompted a Content Advisory warning.ResultsOur sample of 201 Instagram posts led to identification of 10 ambiguous NSSI hashtags. NSSI terms included \#blithe, \#cat, and \#selfinjuryy. We discovered a popular image that described the broader community of NSSI and mental illness, called “\#MySecretFamily.” The term \#MySecretFamily had approximately 900,000 search results at Time 1 and {\textgreater}1.5 million at Time 2. Only one-third of the relevant hashtags generated Content Advisory warnings.ConclusionsNSSI content is popular on Instagram and often veiled by ambiguous hashtags.

We suggest that the size of a sample with sufficient information power depends on (a) the aim of the study, (b) sample specificity, (c) use of established theory, (d) quality of dialogue, and (e) analysis strategy. We present a model where these elements of information and their relevant dimensions are related to information power. Application of this model in the planning and during data collection of a qualitative study is discussed.},

	abstract = {For decades, researchers have noted the importance of understanding how individual differences influence health and well-being. Toward this end, studies have consistently supported the role of personality variables, such as traits, motives, and goals, as informative for predicting current and future health outcomes. While initial work along this front focused solely on the “direct effects” of personality dispositions on health, more recent work has focused on understanding the pathways by which this influence occurs, as well as the extent to which personality effects get “under the skin” and predict physiological markers. Given the changing contexts and behaviors that influence health, as well as the developmental specificity of certain disorders and illnesses, research on personality and health cannot operate without acknowledgment of the aging process. In other words, researchers must actively consider the effects of personality on health through the lens of lifespan developmental theories.},

The personality trait of neuroticism, reflecting a relatively stable tendency towards negative emotions, has also been associated with elevated rates of death in some studies.

Distress symptoms were positively related to risk of total mortality (age-adjusted and sex-adjusted HR per SD increase in distress; 95\% CI 1.23; 1.20 to 1.26). This gradient was, in fact, slightly strengthened after adding neuroticism to the multivariable model (1.30; 1.26 to 1.34) but markedly attenuated after taking into account other covariates which included health behaviours and somatic disease (1.16; 1.12 to 1.20).

The results indicated substantial consistency in those predictions across cultures for several of the criteria. Furthermore, the narrow traits were able to account for more criterion variance than were the broad factors underlying those traits.

More comprehensive tests are needed to understand the gap between capacities and current demands to help guide efforts to educate children and adults about health issues and to develop health-related information that more of the general public can understand. For research, new instruments are needed that will measure individuals reading fluency more precisely without posing an undue response burden. Computer-assisted testing, which selects items from a bank of possible items according to a baseline-predicted reading ability and responses to previous questions, should allow more accurate measurement of indiidual capacity without increasing the time required to complete testing. It remains unclear whether it is possible to develop an accurate, practical “screening” test to identify individuals with limited health literacy. Even if this goal is achieved, it remains unclear whether it is better to screen patients or to adopt “universal precautions” to avoid miscommunication by using plain language in all oral and written communication and confirming understanding with all patients by having them repeat back their understanding of their diagnosis and treatment plan. George Bernard Shaw said, “The main problem with communication is the assumption that it has occurred.” This is a universal truth that transcends reading ability.},

The current aim was to find out whether a student’s sense of purpose in life mediated the relationship between his/her psychological capital (PsyCap) comprising hope, generalized self-efficacy, resilience, optimism (HERO; Luthans and Youssef-Morgan. Annual Review of Organizational Psychology and Organizational Behavior, 4, 339–366, 2017) and satisfaction with life. Furthermore, it was asked which factor contributes more to students’ satisfaction with life, PsyCap or purpose in life? Thus, apprentices completed the Adult Dispositional Hope Scale (Snyder et al. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 60(4), 570–585, 1991), General Self-Efficacy Scale (Schwarzer and Jerusalem. Causal and Control Beliefs, 1, 35–37, 1995), Resilience Scale (Wagnild and Young. Journal of Nursing Measurement, 1(2), 165–17847, 1993), Life Orientation Test-Revised (Scheier et al.

Journal of Clinical Psychology, 20(2), 200–207, 1964) and Satisfaction with life scale (Diener et al. Journal of Personality Assessment, 49(1), 71–75, 1985). The results disclosed grade differences in PsyCap elements. Moreover, positive and significant correlations between any of two variables were found, thus allowing for further analysis. Structural equation modeling revealed that students’ satisfaction with life was directly predicted by PsyCap per se as well as indirectly projected by means of the construct purpose in life. Based on the present assessment, PsyCap contributed more to students’ satisfaction with life than their experienced purpose in life.},

While main effects of personality and situation characteristics on sociability are well established, there is little evidence for the existence of person-situation interaction effects within real-life social interactions. Moreover, previous research has focused on self-reported behavior ratings, and less is known about the partner’s social perspective, i.e. how partners perceive and influence an actor’s behavior. In the current research, we investigated predictors of sociable behavior in real-life social interactions across social perspectives, including person and situation main effects as well as person-situation interaction effects. In two experience-sampling studies (Study 1: N = 394, US, time-based; Study 2: N = 124, Germany, event-based), we assessed personality traits with self- and informant-reports, self-reported sociable behavior during real-life social interactions, and corresponding information on the situation (categorical situation classifications and dimensional ratings of situation characteristics). In Study 2, we additionally assessed interaction partner-reported actor behavior. Multilevel analyses provided evidence for main effects of personality and situation features, as well as small but consistent evidence for person-situation interaction effects. First, extraverts acted more sociable in general. Second, individuals behaved more sociable in low-effort/positive/low-duty situations (vs. high-effort/negative/high-duty situations). Third, the latter was particularly true for extraverts. Further specific interaction effects were found for the partner’s social perspective. These results are discussed regarding their accordance with different behavioral models (e.g., Trait Activation Theory) and their transferability to other behavioral domains.},

	abstract = {Research on relationships between personality and cognitive abilities has so far resulted in inconsistent findings regarding the strength of the associations. Moreover, relationships have rarely been compared longitudinally and bidirectionally between midlife versus late-life cohorts by considering different personality traits as well as multiple cognitive domains over a long-term follow-up period. We hypothesize that the interplay between the “Big Five” personality traits (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness) and cognitive abilities (information processing speed, crystallized intelligence, fluid intelligence) may change from midlife to old age due to age-associated changes in cognitive and personality plasticity. We used data from the German Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study of Adult Development (ILSE study; n = 1,002). Participants were either born in 1950/52 (midlife sample, n = 502) or in 1930/32 (late-life sample, n = 500) and followed up for up to 12 years. Based on bivariate latent change score regression models (adjusted for gender, education, self-rated and physician-rated health), we observed that, apart from very few exceptions, the intervariable cross-lagged associations between personality traits and cognitive abilities were generally similar between cohorts. Moreover, in case of neuroticism, extraversion, and openness, the effects of cognitive abilities on change in personality were stronger than the reversed effects. Our findings thus suggest that the so far predominant perspective of personality in middle adulthood and late-life as a predictor, rather than as an outcome, of cognitive abilities needs more differentiation and reconsideration.},

Although Francis Galton wrote many years ago, no one has presented more cogently the arguments for attempting to measure character. Many of his suggestions concerning possible methods of measuring character have been utilized by later investigators. The student should note that Galton used the word character in a wide sense, not limiting it to moral traits. His usage of character is almost synonymous with the present-day connotation of personality. The points Galton endeavors to impress are chiefly these. First, that character ought to be measured by carefully recorded acts, representative of the usual conduct. An ordinary generalization is nothing more than a muddle of vague memories of inexact observations. It is an easy vice to generalize. We want lists of facts, every one of which may be separately verified, valued and revalued, and the whole accurately summed. It is the statistics of each man's conduct in small everyday affairs, that will probably be found to give the simplest and most precise measure of his character. The other chief point is that a practice of deliberately and methodically testing the character of others and of ourselves is not wholly fanciful, but deserves consideration and experiment.},

A sample (N ¼ 6,904) of participants from the Health and Retirement Study, a longitudinal study of older adults, completed personality measures and reported on current health conditions. Four years later, participants were followed up to see if they developed a new disease. Initial cross-sectional analyses replicated past findings that personality traits differ across disease groups. Longitudinal logistic regression analyses predicting new disease diagnosis suggest that traits are associated with the risk of developing disease—most notably the traits of conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness.

To investigate the role of age in this diversity, the present study examined whether emerging adults differ from an older group of young adults in their Big Five personality development. By means of multi‐group latent change modelling, two groups of 16‐ to 19‐year‐olds (n = 3555) and 26‐ to 29‐year‐olds (n = 2621) were tracked over the course of four years and compared regarding four aspects of personality change: mean‐level change, rank‐order change, inter‐individual differences in change, and profile change. In addition, age‐differential socialization effects associated with six first‐time life events were investigated. Analyses revealed substantial age differences in all four aspects of change. As expected, emerging adults showed greater change and diversity in change than young adults. However, the six life events had no age‐differential impact on change in single traits and Big Five profiles. Overall, the results indicate that age differences should be considered even in specific life stages to advance the understanding of personality development. © 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology},

This approach implicitly assumes that the scales are strictly measurement invariant across age. We questioned this assumption by examining whether appropriate personality indicators change over the lifespan. Moreover, we identified which types of items (e.g. dispositions, behaviours, and interests) are particularly prone to age effects. We reanalyzed the German Revised NEO Personality Inventory normative sample (N = 11,724) and applied a genetic algorithm to select short scales that yield acceptable model fit and reliability across locally weighted samples ranging from 16 to 66 years of age. We then examined how the item selection changes across age points and item types. Emotion‐type items seemed to be interchangeable and generally applicable to people of all ages. Specific interests, attitudes, and social effect items—most prevalent within the domains of Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Openness—seemed to be more prone to measurement variations over age. A large proportion of items were systematically discarded by the item‐selection procedure, indicating that, independent of age, many items are problematic measures of the underlying traits. The implications for personality assessment and personality development research are discussed. © 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology},

Identifying at-risk groups with tendencies of not joining pension plans will help governments target strategies to improve pension awareness and participation. This study investigates the role of personality traits in pension decision making using data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study. Our results demonstrate that Extraversion significantly correlates with non-participation in private pensions, including both employer run and personal pensions. Individuals who are high in Conscientiousness are more likely to participate and pay more into personal pensions. Openness to experience is negatively correlated with saving via personal pensions. Agreeableness and Extraversion correlate inversely with the amount contributed to personal plans. This paper discusses our findings in detail and offers policy implications which may help promote pension participation and ease the problem of old age poverty.},

	abstract = {A growing body of research finds that the activities of the immune system—in addition to protecting the body from infection and injury—also influence how we think, feel, and behave. Although research on the relationship between the immune system and psychological and behavioral outcomes has most commonly focused on the experiences of those who are ill or experiencing an acute immune response, we propose that the immune system may also play a key role in influencing such outcomes in those who are healthy. Here, we review theory and research suggesting that inflammation—a key component of the immune response to pathogens and stressors—may play an important modulatory role in shaping emotions, motivation, cognition, and behavior, even among those without symptoms of illness. Moreover, because inflammation occurs in response to a number of everyday social experiences (e.g., loneliness and stress), we propose that it may be an important mediator of many psychological and behavioral outcomes that are of interest to social and personality psychologists. We close by discussing potential opportunities for researchers looking to incorporate psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) into their area of inquiry.},

With this paper, we set out to illustrate some of the possibilities and challenges in modelling age‐related differences and time‐related changes in personality psychology by means of dynamic panel models. To this end, we first distinguish between the study of age‐related differences and time‐related changes and demonstrate how the treatment of age and time as either discrete or continuous variables implies important modelling choices. Second, we present a selection of four example cases that address the topic of age moderation in diverse matters and with different objectives. Based on our cross‐tabulation of age and time as discrete and continuous variables, the first two example cases represent fairly well‐established models (cases A and B), whereas the remaining cases are used to illustrate current developments in the field (cases C and D).

Progress is hamstrung by siloed scientific traditions and a focus on explanation over prediction, two issues that are particularly damaging for the study of multifaceted constructs like self-regulation. Here, we derive a psychological ontology from a study of individual differences across a broad range of behavioral tasks, self-report surveys, and self-reported real-world outcomes associated with self-regulation. Though both tasks and surveys putatively measure self-regulation, they show little empirical relationship. Within tasks and surveys, however, the ontology identifies reliable individual traits and reveals opportunities for theoretic synthesis. We then evaluate predictive power of the psychological measurements and find that while surveys modestly and heterogeneously predict real-world outcomes, tasks largely do not. We conclude that self-regulation lacks coherence as a construct, and that data-driven ontologies lay the groundwork for a cumulative psychological science. Scientific progress relies on integrating and building on existing knowledge. Here, the authors propose improving cumulative science by developing data-driven ontologies, and they apply this approach to understanding the construct of self-regulation.},

Similarity in extraversion predicted a higher likelihood of friendship selection across 4 years in Sample 1 (n = 1,698; Mage = 22.72, SD = 2.99; 49\% female) and across a period of 16 weeks in Sample 2 (n = 131; Mage = 21.34, SD = 3.95; 77\% female). Friends’ extraversion predicted increases in young adults’ extraversion in both samples. In Sample 2, we examined the interaction mechanisms underlying selection and influence by combining event-based experience-sampling network changes with diary data on friendship network and extraversion changes. Findings showed that (a) similarity in extraversion predicted positive interaction quality changes and (b) positive interaction quality predicted friendship selection (bonding mechanism). In the same model, (a) friends’ extraversion predicted friends’ sociable behavior changes, (b) friends’ sociable behavior predicted young adults’ sociable behavior changes, and (c) young adults’ sociable behavior predicted young adults’ extraversion changes (behavioral mimicry mechanism). These findings provide unique insight into interaction mechanisms underlying longitudinal links between friendships and extraversion.},

We aim to extend these findings to a sample of adolescents selected for gambling behavior. Participants consisted of a racially diverse sample of adolescents between the ages of 13 and 17 (n = 227). We collected self-reported information on normal-range personality traits, sensation-seeking, and gambling frequency, severity, and motives in an online survey. Normal-range personality traits were not correlated with gambling, but trait sensation-seeking was positively correlated with gambling. Latent class analyses showed that classes of adolescent gamblers may be differentiated based on personality trait patterns, although these classes were not differentiated on gambling severity or frequency. Finally, in hierarchical analyses, six homogenous components representing the five normal-range personality traits and sensation-seeking accounted for maximum variance in gambling outcomes. In this model, components representing sensation-seeking and conscientiousness were the only significant unique predictors of gambling-related outcomes. Our findings suggest that subgroups of adolescent gamblers may be distinguished based on personality trait patterns before the emergence of problematic gambling. In other words, personality differences may reflect an early predisposition to divergent pathways to adolescent gambling. Our findings concur with previous work and underscore the importance of sensation-seeking as a particularly important risk factor of initiation and escalation of adolescent gambling.},

We tested this universality argument in a cross-cultural dataset of 30 diverse societies spanning the WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic) and non-WEIRD cultures by testing measurement invariance of the short-form of the moral foundations questionnaire. The results supported the original conceptualization that there are at least five diverse moralities although loadings of items differ across WEIRD and non-WEIRD cultures.

Participants were 431 individuals who participated in an online study that varied the length of stimulus target observations (30 seconds, 1 minute, 3 minutes, and 5 minutes), after which judges rated targets using other‐report measures of the Big Five personality traits. For all traits combined, significant levels of accuracy were found for all observation lengths, but distinctive accuracy and normativity did not increase as video length increased. Findings varied for individual traits. For distinctive accuracy, there was a linear increase with information quantity for Extraversion and a non‐linear relationship for Conscientiousness, while there was a linear decrease for Openness.

	abstract = {Objective: Illness behaviors—or responses to bodily symptoms—predict individuals’ recovery and functioning; however, there has been little research on the early life personality antecedents of illness behavior. This study’s primary aims were to evaluate (a) childhood temperament traits (i.e., emotionality and sociability) as predictors of adult illness behaviors, independent of objective health; and (b) adult temperament traits for mediation of childhood temperament’s associations. Method: Participants included 714 (53\% male; 350 adoptive family and 364 control family) children and siblings from the Colorado Adoption Project (CAP; Plomin \& DeFries, 1983). Structural regression analyses evaluated paths from childhood temperament to illness behavior (i.e., somatic complaints, sick days, and medication use) at two adulthood assessments (CAP years 21 and 30). Analyses controlled for participant age, sex, family type (adoptive or control), adopted status, parent education/occupation, and middle childhood illnesses, doctor visits, and life events stress. Results: Latent illness behavior factors were established across 2 adulthood assessments. Multilevel path analyses revealed that higher emotionality (fearfulness) in adulthood—but not childhood temperament—predicted higher levels of illness behavior at both assessments. Lastly, lower emotionality-fearfulness partially mediated the effect of higher childhood sociability on adult illness behavior. Conclusions: Results suggest the importance of childhood illness experiences and adult emotionality (fearfulness) in shaping illness behavior in early adulthood. They also suggest a small, protective role of childhood sociability on reduced trait fearfulness in adulthood. These findings broaden our understanding of the prospective links between temperament and illness behavior development, suggesting distinct associations from early life illness experiences.},

In this work, we examine the impact of subtle cognitive deficits on structural substrates of personality in the elderly using DTI derived white matter (WM) integrity measure, Fractional Anisotropy (FA). We employed canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to study the relationship between personality factors of the NEOPI-R and FA measures in two population groups: healthy controls and MCI. Agreeableness was the only personality factor to be associated with FA patterns in both groups. Openness was significantly related to FA data in the MCI group and the inverse was true for Conscientiousness. Furthermore, we generated saliency maps using bootstrapping strategy which revealed a larger number of positive correlations in healthy aging in contrast to the MCI status. The MCI group was found to be associated with a predominance of negative correlations indicating that higher Agreeableness and Openness scores were mostly related to lower FA values in interhemispheric and cortico-spinal tracts and a limited number of higher FA values in cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical connection. Altogether these findings support the idea that WM microstructure may represent a valid correlate of personality dimensions and also indicate that the presence of early cognitive deficits led to substantial changes in the associations between WM integrity and personality factors.},

First, we used a pairwise GWAS analysis to classify variants as associated with only depression, with only neuroticism, or with both. Second, we estimated partial genetic correlations to test whether the depression's genetic link with other phenotypes was explained by shared overlap with neuroticism. We found evidence that most genetic variants associated with depression are likely to be shared with neuroticism. The overlapping common genetic variance of depression and neuroticism was negatively genetically correlated with cognitive function and positively genetically correlated with several psychiatric disorders. We found that the genetic contributions unique to depression, and not shared with neuroticism, were correlated with inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and sleep patterns. Our findings demonstrate that, while genetic risk factors for depression are largely shared with neuroticism, there are also non-neuroticism related features of depression that may be useful for further patient or phenotypic stratification.},

One challenge to documenting social behavior tendencies is the broad number of channels over which socializing can occur, both in-person and through digital media. To examine individual differences in everyday social behavior patterns, here we used smartphone-based mobile sensing methods (MSMs) in four studies (total N = 926) to collect real-world data about young adults’ social behaviors across four communication channels: conversations, phone calls, text messages, and use of messaging and social media applications. To examine individual differences, we first focused on establishing between-person variability in daily social behavior, examining stability of and relationships among daily sensed social behavior tendencies. To explore factors that may explain the observed individual differences in sensed social behavior, we then expanded our focus to include other time estimates (e.g., times of the day, days of the week) and personality traits. In doing so, we present the first large-scale descriptive portrait of behavioral sociability patterns, characterizing the degree to which young adults engaged in social behaviors and mapping these behaviors onto self-reported personality dispositions. Our discussion focuses on how the observed sociability patterns compare to previous research on young adults’ social behavior. We conclude by pointing to areas for future research aimed at understanding sociability using mobile sensing and other naturalistic observation methods for the assessment of social behavior.},

In a cross-sectional study of 207 patients with breast cancer, they completed a set of questionnaires at two general hospitals. The measures used were demographic and individual characteristics, personality traits, ways of coping, and health surveys. We used correlations and hierarchical regressions to determine all relationships among factors, sleep disorders, personality, coping, and HRQOL. Most participants were reported as having stage II (77, 37.2\%) breast cancer. About 60\% patients with breast cancer have poor sleep and sleep disorders having a negative association with HRQOL. Participants using more active coping, with lower neuroticism, and higher agreeableness traits are more likely to have a better physical quality of life (PQOL). In the PQOL regression model, clinical conditions (duration since cancer diagnosis; sleep disorders) and two personality traits (neuroticism and agreeableness) significantly explained 23\% of variance. Moreover, fewer sleep disorders and two personality traits (neuroticism and conscientiousness) significantly explained 31\% of variance in the mental quality-of-life (MQOL) regression model. A high prevalence of sleep disorders for patients with breast cancer has occurred and sleep disorders were negatively associated with PQOL and MQOL. In addition, neuroticism was positively related to sleep disorders and could be relevant to psycho-educational interventions.},

This prediction was confirmed in four experiments examining property induction following exposure to identical samples that were subject to different sampling frames. Each experiment found narrower generalization of a novel property when the sample instances were selected because they shared a common property (property sampling) than when they were selected because they belonged to the same category (category sampling). In line with model predictions, sampling frame effects were moderated by the addition of explicit negative evidence (Experiment 1), sample size (Experiment 2) and category base rates (Experiments 3–4). These data show that reasoners are sensitive to constraints on the sampling process when making property inferences; they consider both the observed evidence and the reasons why certain types of evidence has not been observed.},

Results The new sample (n = 50) and meta-analysis (18 samples; n = 542) found consistent shifts in personality from the premorbid to current state in patients with cognitive impairment. The largest changes ({\textgreater}1 standard deviation) were declines in conscientiousness (particularly for the facets of self-discipline and competence) and extraversion (decreased energy and assertiveness), as well as increases in neuroticism (increased vulnerability to stress). The new sample suggested that personality changes were larger in individuals taking cognition-enhancing medications (cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine). More recent studies and those that examined individuals with MCI found smaller effects. Conclusions and implications Consistent with the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of dementia, the new study and meta-analysis found replicable evidence for large changes in personality among individuals with dementia. Future research should examine whether there are different patterns of personality changes across etiologies of dementia to inform differential diagnosis and treatments. Prospective, repeated assessments of personality using both self- and informant-reports are essential to clarify the temporal evolution of personality change across the preclinical, prodromal, and clinical phases of dementia.},

	abstract = {Sleep is one key feature of people's lives that defines their daily routine and reflects overall health and well‐being. To test the relevance of personality for core aspects of sleep, we examined if personality traits across the five broad personality domains predicted behaviourally recorded, week‐long sleep characteristics up to five years later (alongside subjective sleep quality). Data from 382 participants (63\% female, aged 34–82 years) were drawn from the longitudinal study on Midlife in the United States Study—Biomarker project. In terms of mean tendencies, both neuroticism and conscientiousness signalled more sleep continuity (fewer interruptions) alongside better subjective quality. In terms of intra‐individual sleep variability, neuroticism predicted more variability in sleep duration, continuity, and subjective sleep quality, while conscientiousness predicted less variability in sleep duration and sleep continuity. Extraversion, agreeableness, and openness traits did not generally foreshadow behaviourally recoded sleep, only higher ratings of subjective quality. These links were robust to the impact of demographic factors and were not moderated by the duration of time between personality and sleep assessments. The findings distinguish which personality traits foreshadow core aspects of sleep and also implicate multiple traits as predictors of variability, not just mean tendencies, in behaviourally recorded sleep. © 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology},

	abstract = {Objective: The goal of this study was to use the risk and resistance framework to examine whether a set of psychosocial variables measured at age 12 in youth with Type 1 diabetes would predict the emergence of diabetes risk and complication variables 11 years and 13 years later. Method: We interviewed youth with Type 1 diabetes when they were average age 12 and followed them for 11 years until they were average age 23 and then average age 25. At age 12, we measured personality traits (unmitigated communion, unmitigated agency), relationship variables (parent relationship quality, friend support, friend conflict), indicators of psychological well-being (depressive symptoms, bulimic symptoms, self-worth), and self-care behavior. We used these psychosocial variables assessed at age 12 to predict diabetes risk factors, glycemic control, and the emergence of diabetes complications at follow-up. Results: Higher unmitigated agency, poor quality parent relationships, higher friend conflict, bulimic symptoms, and lower self-worth predicted one or more diabetes outcomes. When statistical controls for age 12 glycemic control were employed, unmitigated agency emerged as the most robust predictor of diabetes outcomes. Conclusion: Unmitigated agency, which involves an overly inflated view of the self and a cynical view of others, predicted poor diabetes outcomes over an 11-year and 13-year period. The processes by which unmitigated agency could influence health are discussed.},

	abstract = {The Five-Factor model of personality has been associated with a wide range of health behaviors and health outcomes. However, few studies have examined whether personality traits are related to cancer screening in older adults. The present study investigated the cross-sectional associations between personality traits and the probability of obtaining a recent preventive screening for breast, cervical, prostate, and colorectal cancer. Participants from the Health and Retirement Study (N = 14,394, M age = 68.14 years, range = 50–102 years, 58.6\% female) completed a personality inventory and reported on cancer screenings in the 2010–2012 assessment. Logistic regression models were used to analyze the data, including age, race, ethnicity, gender, education, income, and wealth as covariates. Higher conscientiousness was associated with a higher likelihood of obtaining breast, cervical, and prostate screening. Higher extraversion was related to higher odds of breast, cervical, and colorectal screening. Higher neuroticism was linked to higher odds of colorectal screening, and conscientiousness moderated the link between neuroticism and cervical screening. These associations were significant in models that accounted for demographic and socioeconomic factors. The effect sizes were in the range of a 10–20\% higher likelihood of cancer screening for 1 SD difference in personality. The present findings suggest that conscientiousness and extraversion were related to preventive cancer screenings, whereas neuroticism, openness and agreeableness were largely unrelated to the likelihood of such screenings. If these results are further replicated, health policy makers may consider personality traits when planning and implementing screening recommendations to improve preventive medicine.},

Prospective studies indicate that individuals who score higher on conscientiousness (more responsible and self-disciplined) and lower on neuroticism (less anxious and vulnerable to stress) have a reduced risk of developing dementia, even in the presence of AD neuropathology. Personality is also related to measures of cognitive performance and cognitive decline, with effect sizes similar to those of other clinical, lifestyle, and behavioral risk factors. These associations are unlikely to be due to reverse causality: Long-term prospective data indicate that there are no changes in personality that are an early sign of the disease during the preclinical phase of AD. With the onset and progression of dementia, however, there are large changes in personality that are reported consistently by caregivers in retrospective studies and are consistent with the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of dementia. The review also discusses potential mechanisms of the observed associations and emphasizes the need for prospective studies to elucidate the interplay of personality traits with AD neuropathology (amyloid and tau biomarkers) in modulating the risk and timing of onset of clinical dementia. The article concludes with the implications of personality research for identifying those at greater risk of AD and the potential of personality-tailored interventions aimed at the prevention and treatment of AD.},

	abstract = {Sociometric status, the regard that other group members confer to an individual, is one of the most ubiquitous and behaviourally relevant attributes assigned to the person by the social environment. Despite this, its contribution to personality development has received little attention. The present three‐wave longitudinal study, spanning the age range 7–13 years (n = 1222), sought to fill this gap by examining the transactional pathways between peer sociometric status (measured by peer nominations) and Five‐Factor personality traits (measured by self‐ratings and parent and teacher ratings). Sociometric status prospectively predicted the development of extraversion. By contrast, agreeableness and neuroticism prospectively predicted the development of sociometric status. Furthermore, individual‐level stability in extraversion was associated with individual‐level stability in sociometric status. The results were robust across different sources of personality ratings. We argue that peer sociometric status in the school classroom is the type of environmental effect that has potential to explain personality development. Because of its stability, broadness, and possible impact across a variety of personality processes, sociometric status can both repetitiously and simultaneously influence the network of multiple inter‐correlated micro‐level personality processes, potentially leading to a new network equilibrium that manifests in changes at the level of the broad personality trait. © 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology},

	abstract = {Openness to experience has been found to be a correlate of successful aging outcomes yet also has been found to decline from middle age onward. We hypothesized that decline in openness would be associated with death. Using longitudinal data from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA), the analytic sample encompassed 1954 individuals, approximately two-thirds of whom were deceased. We tested whether openness declines across late adulthood and, central to our hypothesis, whether the decline correlated with age at death. Multivariate modeling adjusted for age at study entry, sex, education, as well as the time-varying effects of physical illness, depressive symptoms, and cognitive ability. Correlations between change in neuroticism and extraversion and death were modeled for comparison. A follow-up cotwin control analysis adjusted for genetic and environmental familial confounders. Significant mean-level change was identified in all personality traits, but only for openness was change correlated with age at death, in support of our hypothesis. The findings were not explained by health factors or cognition. Cotwin control analyses indicated that the twin who died earlier showed a greater drop in openness prior to death, compared with their cotwin measured at the same time points. There was no cotwin finding for neuroticism or extraversion. We suggest that declines in openness may reflect a change in goal orientation due to the experience of a shortened time horizon, leading to an optimized selection of experiences as people approach the end of life.},

These revelations suggest that it is time to change how psychological science is carried out and increase the transparency of reporting. We argue that change will be slow until institutions adopt new procedures for evaluating scholarly activity. We consider three actions that individuals and departments can take to facilitate change throughout psychological science: the development of individualized research-philosophy statements, the creation of an annotated curriculum vitae to improve the transparency of scholarly reporting, and the use of a formal evaluative system that explicitly captures behaviors that support reproducibility. Our recommendations build on proposals for open science by enabling researchers to have a voice in articulating (and contextualizing) how they would like their work to be evaluated and by providing a mechanism for more detailed and transparent reporting of scholarly activities.},

Method: Two groups of male veterans from the 1982 Lebanon War participated in this study in 1983 (T1) and 2016 (T2): the CSR group (n = 375) and a matched comparison group (n = 305) consisting of combatants who had participated in combat in the same units as the CSR group but were not identified as having CSR. Participants were assessed for posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and depressive symptoms in T1 and mortality in T2. Results: The distribution of mortality rates was significantly different between the 2 groups and higher among the CSR group (n = 32, 8.5\%) as compared to the comparison group (n = 12, 3.9\%; χ2 = 5.89, p = .01). Both posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and depressive symptoms were controlled for because they have been shown to be risk factors for all-cause mortality. The mortality curve of the CSR group increased steeply around the age of 40 years, whereas in the comparison group, the increase was less substantial. Conclusions: CSR was found to be a significant predictor of all-cause mortality. The risk for mortality was higher and earlier among the CSR group compared with the comparison group. The findings of this study call attention to the importance of immediately identifying CSR to better care for the individual and minimize long-term negative effects.},

With respect to personality, previous findings support a relationship between neuroticism and cognitive abilities. However, findings regarding old age are inconsistent. In particular, little is known about potentially moderating variables which might explain some of the inconsistency. Our aim was to examine the moderating effect of severe sensory impairment on cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between neuroticism and cognitive functioning.Method: The study sample consisted of 121 visually impaired (VI), 116 hearing impaired (HI), and 150 sensory unimpaired older adults (UI). Mean age was 82.50 years (SD = 4.71 years). Neuroticism was assessed by the NEO Five Factor Inventory, and multiple established tests were used for the assessment of cognitive performance (e.g., subtests of the revised Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale).Results: Bivariate correlations and multi-group structural equation models indicated stronger relationships between cognitive abilities and neuroticism in both sensory impaired groups (VI and HI) compared to UI older individuals. This relationship was attenuated but still significant in both sensory impaired groups when controlling for age, education and health (number of chronic conditions). In cross-lagged panel models, higher baseline neuroticism was significantly associated with lower cognitive performance four years later in VI and HI individuals.Conclusion: Our results suggest that sensory impairment moderates both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between neuroticism and cognitive function in advanced old age.},

At enrollment in 2 longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort studies, 309 older individuals without cognitive impairment completed a standard conscientiousness measure. Annually thereafter, they completed a battery of 17 cognitive tests. On death, they underwent a uniform neuropathologic examination from which measures of neurofibrillary tangles, Lewy bodies, chronic gross cerebral infarction, and hippocampal sclerosis were derived. The relation of conscientiousness and the neuropathologic markers to cognitive decline was assessed in mixed-effects change point models to accommodate nonlinear cognitive decline. During a mean of 10.7 years of follow-up, annual decline on a composite measure of global cognition (baseline M = 0.082, SD = 0.499) was gradual (estimated M = −0.036, 95\% CI [−0.046, −0.025]) until a mean of 3.2 years before death (95\% CI [−3.6, −2.8]) when it accelerated to a mean annual loss of 0.369 unit (95\% CI [−0.426, –0.317]), a tenfold increase. Higher conscientiousness (baseline M = 33.6, SD = 5.1) was associated with slower terminal decline (estimate = 0.064, 95\% CI [0.024, 0.103]) but not preterminal decline (estimate = 0.005, 95\% CI [−0.003, 0.013]). After adjustment for neuropathologic burden, conscientiousness was still related to terminal decline (estimate = 0.057, 95\% CI [0.019, 0.094]) and accounted for 4\% of the variance in terminal slopes. In addition, the association of neocortical Lewy bodies with terminal cognitive decline was attenuated in those with higher conscientiousness. The results suggest that higher conscientiousness is protective of late-life cognitive health.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Personality characteristics are associated with many risk behaviors. However, the relationship between personality traits, risky driving behavior, and crash risk is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between personality, risky driving behavior, and crashes and near-crashes, using naturalistic driving research methods. Method: Participants' driving exposure, kinematic risky driving (KRD), high-risk secondary task engagement, and the frequency of crashes and near-crashes (CNC) were assessed over the first 18months of licensure using naturalistic driving methods. A personality survey (NEO-Five Factor Inventory) was administered at baseline. The association between personality characteristics, KRD rate, secondary task engagement rate, and CNC rate was estimated using a linear regression model. Mediation analysis was conducted to examine if participants' KRD rate or secondary task engagement rate mediated the relationship between personality and CNC. Data were collected as part of the Naturalistic Teen Driving Study. Results: Conscientiousness was marginally negatively associated with CNC (path c=−0.034, p=.09) and both potential mediators KRD (path a=−0.040, p=.09) and secondary task engagement while driving (path a=−0.053, p=.03). KRD, but not secondary task engagement, was found to mediate (path b=0.376, p=.02) the relationship between conscientiousness and CNC (path c′=−0.025, p=.20). Conclusions: Using objective measures of driving behavior and a widely used personality construct, these findings present a causal pathway through which personality and risky driving are associated with CNC. Specifically, more conscientious teenage drivers engaged in fewer risky driving maneuvers, and suffered fewer CNC. Practical Applications: Part of the variability in crash risk observed among newly licensed teenage drivers can be explained by personality. Parents and driving instructors may take teenage drivers' personality into account when providing guidance, and establishing norms and expectations about driving.},

Measures of white matter microstructure are known to correlate cross-sectionally with cognitive ability measures, but only a few small studies have tested for longitudinal relations among these variables. We tested whether there were coupled changes in brain white matter microstructure indexed by fractional anisotropy (FA) and three broad cognitive domains (fluid intelligence, processing speed, and memory) in a large cohort of human participants with longitudinal diffusion tensor MRI and detailed cognitive data taken at ages 73 years (n = 731) and 76 years (n = 488). Longitudinal changes in white matter microstructure were coupled with changes in fluid intelligence, but not with processing speed or memory. Individuals with higher baseline white matter FA showed less subsequent decline in processing speed. Our results provide evidence for a longitudinal link between changes in white matter microstructure and aging-related cognitive decline during the eighth decade of life. They are consistent with theoretical perspectives positing that a corticocortical “disconnection” partly explains cognitive aging.},

Previous research has shown that subjective memory ratings are partly based on memory performance but also reflect the influence of other factors, such as depressive symptoms. The aim of the present study was to examine (1) longitudinal associations between trajectories of subjective memory and memory performance, (2) variables that predict levels of and changes in subjective memory and memory performance, and (3) variables that moderate associations between these constructs. We applied a latent growth curve model to four occasions of data from 15,824 participants of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS; mean age at baseline = 64.27 years, SD = 9.90; 58\% women). Results revealed that latent changes in subjective memory were correlated with latent changes in memory performance (φ = 0.49), indicating that participants who reported steeper declines of subjective memory indeed showed steeper declines of memory performance over time. Three major patterns of associations emerged with respect to predictors of subjective memory and subjective memory change. First, the level of memory performance showed stronger associations with age, gender, and education, whereas subjective memory was more strongly associated with subjective age and personality traits. For example, women performed better than men on the episodic memory test, but there were no gender differences in subjective memory. Also, older age was associated with steeper declines of memory performance but with less decline of subjective memory. Second, personality traits that predicted subjective memory intercepts did not predict subjective memory slopes. Third, the strength of associations between levels and slopes of subjective memory and memory performance varied as a function of gender, education, depressive symptoms, and personality traits. Conscientiousness moderated the relationship of the level of subjective memory to the level of memory performance, consistent with the hypothesis that persons high in conscientiousness more accurately monitor memory successes and failures. The results reinforce the importance of depressive symptoms as a predictor of subjective memory but also indicate that a broader perspective on the reasons why memory complaints have modest correlations with memory itself is needed.},

	abstract = {Objective: To examine the relation of performance on brief cognitive tests to development of clinically diagnosed Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia over the following 18 years in a sample of African Americans and European Americans. Methods: A composite cognitive test score based on tests of episodic memory, executive function, and global cognition was constructed in a prospective population-based sample of 2,125 participants (55\&percnt; African American and 61\&percnt; female) aged 65 years and older residing in 4 Chicago neighborhoods. Time before AD dementia diagnosis was categorized into 6 groups corresponding to data collection periods: 0.1–0.9, 1.0–3.9, 4.0–6.9, 7.0–9.9, 10.0–12.9, and 13.0–17.9 years. Results: Of 2,125 participants without clinical AD dementia, 442 (21\&percnt;) developed clinical AD dementia over 18 years of follow-up. Lower composite cognitive test scores were associated with the development of AD dementia over the duration of the study. The magnitude of association between composite cognitive test score and development of AD dementia increased from an odds ratio of 3.39 (95\&percnt; confidence interval 1.72, 6.67; p {\textless} 0.001) at 13.0–17.9 years to 9.84 (95\&percnt; confidence interval 7.41, 13.06; p {\textless} 0.001) at 0.1–0.9 years, per SD increment. These associations were consistently larger among European Americans than among African Americans. Performance on individual cognitive tests of episodic memory, executive function, and global cognition also significantly predicted the development of AD dementia, with associations exhibiting a similar trend over 18 years. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that cognitive impairment may manifest in the preclinical phase of AD dementia substantially earlier than previously established.},

	abstract = {In personality research, trait–outcome associations are often studied by correlating scale sum scores with an outcome. For example, an association between the NEO Impulsiveness scale and body mass index (BMI) is often interpreted to pertain to underlying trait Impulsiveness. We propose that this expectation can be corroborated by testing for Spearman's theorem of indifference of indicator. Namely, an underlying trait–outcome association should not depend on the specific items (i.e. indicators) used to measure the trait. To test this theorem, we outline an indicator exclusion procedure and demonstrate its viability using a simulation design. We then apply this procedure to test personality–BMI associations for indifference of indicator in a large population-based sample of adult Estonians (N = 2581) using self-ratings and informant ratings obtained with the NEO Personality Inventory-3. Our results show that the N5: Impulsiveness–BMI association mostly depends on two eating-related items, suggesting that the trait associated with BMI may be narrower than the trait the N5: Impulsiveness scale is supposed to measure. Associations between BMI, E3: Assertiveness and C2: Order seem to pertain to the trait. In sum, testing for indifference of indicator provides a potentially useful method to clarify trait–outcome relationships. R scripts are provided that implement the indicator exclusion procedure.

	abstract = {Objective: Inflammation increases the risk of chronic diseases, but the links between emotional responses to daily events and inflammation are unknown. We examined individual differences in affective reactivity to daily stressors (i.e., changes in positive and negative affect in response to stressors) as predictors of inflammatory markers interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Methods: A cross-sectional sample of 872 adults from the National Study of Daily Experiences (substudy of Midlife in the United States II) reported daily stressors and affect during telephone interviews for 8 days. Blood samples were obtained at a separate clinic visit and assayed for inflammatory markers. Multilevel models estimated trait affective reactivity slopes for each participant, which were inputted into regression models to predict inflammation. Results: People who experienced greater decreases in positive affect on days when stressors occurred (i.e., positive affect reactivity) had elevated log IL-6, independent of demographic, physical, psychological, and behavioral factors (B = 1.12, SE = 0.45, p = .01). Heightened negative affect reactivity was associated with higher log CRP among women (p = .03) but not men (p = .57); health behaviors accounted for this association in women. Conclusions: Adults who fail to maintain positive affect when faced with minor stressors in everyday life appear to have elevated levels of IL-6, a marker of inflammation. Women who experience increased negative affect when faced with minor stressors may be at particular risk of elevated inflammation. These findings add to growing evidence regarding the health implications of affective reactivity to daily stressors.},

We used this model to predict the 5 personality factors in a separate sample of 4,824 Facebook users, examining (a) convergence with self-reports of personality at the domain- and facet-level; (b) discriminant validity between predictions of distinct traits; (c) agreement with informant reports of personality; (d) patterns of correlations with external criteria (e.g., number of friends, political attitudes, impulsiveness); and (e) test–retest reliability over 6-month intervals. Results indicated that language-based assessments can constitute valid personality measures: they agreed with self-reports and informant reports of personality, added incremental validity over informant reports, adequately discriminated between traits, exhibited patterns of correlations with external criteria similar to those found with self-reported personality, and were stable over 6-month intervals. Analysis of predictive language can provide rich portraits of the mental life associated with traits.

Accordingly, the current study utilized a nationally representative, longitudinal sample ({\textless}xh:i xmlns:search="http://marklogic.com/appservices/search" xmlns="http://apa.org/pimain" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xh="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"{\textgreater}N{\textless}/xh:i{\textgreater} = 8,206) to test whether relationship satisfaction is a pathway by which personality traits influence relationship dissolution.

In contrast, the {\textless}xh:i xmlns:search="http://marklogic.com/appservices/search" xmlns="http://apa.org/pimain" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xh="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"{\textgreater}emergent distress{\textless}/xh:i{\textgreater} pathway proposes that personality leads to worsening dynamics across the course of a relationship, which is indicated by changes in satisfaction. For each pathway, we assessed actor, partner, and combined effects for the Big Five. Results replicate previous research in that personality traits prospectively predict relationship dissolution. Both the enduring dynamics and emergent distress pathways served to explain this relationship, though the enduring dynamics model evidenced the largest effects. The emergent distress pathway was stronger for couples who experienced certain life events, suggesting that personality plays a role in adapting to changing life circumstances. Moreover, results suggest that the personality of the dyad is important in this process: Above and beyond actor effects, partner effects influenced relationship functioning (although the influence of combined effects was less clear). In sum, the current study demonstrates that personality traits shape the overall quality of one’s relationship, which in turn influences the likelihood of relationship dissolution.

	abstract = {Taxonomies of person characteristics are well developed, whereas taxonomies of psychologically important situation characteristics are underdeveloped. A working model of situation perception implies the existence of taxonomizable dimensions of psychologically meaningful, important, and consequential situation characteristics tied to situation cues, goal affordances, and behavior. Such dimensions are developed and demonstrated in a multi-method set of 6 studies. First, the “Situational Eight DIAMONDS” dimensions Duty, Intellect, Adversity, Mating, pOsitivity, Negativity, Deception, and Sociality (Study 1) are established from the Riverside Situational Q-Sort (Sherman, Nave, \& Funder, 2010, 2012, 2013; Wagerman \& Funder, 2009). Second, their rater agreement (Study 2) and associations with situation cues and goal/trait affordances (Studies 3 and 4) are examined. Finally, the usefulness of these dimensions is demonstrated by examining their predictive power of behavior (Study 5), particularly vis-à-vis measures of personality and situations (Study 6). Together, we provide extensive and compelling evidence that the DIAMONDS taxonomy is useful for organizing major dimensions of situation characteristics. We discuss the DIAMONDS taxonomy in the context of previous taxonomic approaches and sketch future research directions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)},

	doi = {10.1159/000362328},
	abstract = {Regions of the human brain develop at different rates across the first two decades of life, with some maturing before others. It has been hypothesized that a mismatch in the timing of maturation between subcortical regions (involved in affect and reward processing) and prefrontal regions (involved in cognitive control) underlies the increase in risk-taking and sensation-seeking behaviors observed during adolescence. Most support for this ‘dual systems' hypothesis relies on cross-sectional data, and it is not known whether this pattern is present at an individual level. The current study utilizes longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to describe the developmental trajectories of regions associated with risk-taking and sensation-seeking behaviors, namely, the amygdala, nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Structural trajectories of gray matter volumes were analyzed using FreeSurfer in 33 participants aged 7-30 years, each of whom had at least three high-quality MRI scans spanning three developmental periods: late childhood, adolescence and early adulthood (total 152 scans). The majority of individuals in our sample showed relatively earlier maturation in the amygdala and/or NAcc compared to the PFC, providing evidence for a mismatch in the timing of structural maturation between these structures. We then related individual developmental trajectories to retrospectively assessed self-reported risk-taking and sensation-seeking behaviors during adolescence in a subsample of 24 participants. Analysis of this smaller sample failed to find a relationship between the presence of a mismatch in brain maturation and risk-taking and sensation-seeking behaviors during adolescence. Taken together, it appears that the developmental mismatch in structural brain maturation is present in neurotypically developing individuals. This pattern of development did not directly relate to self-reported behaviors at an individual level in our sample, highlighting the need for prospective studies combining anatomical and behavioral measures.},

Behavioral autonomy, psychological health, risk behaviors, and diabetes outcomes were assessed. Regression analyses were conducted to predict Time 2 and 3 outcomes, controlling for Time 1 outcomes. Results There were no group differences in behavioral autonomy. Behavioral autonomy predicted better psychological health but only for emerging adults without diabetes. Behavioral autonomy was related to increased risk behavior for both groups. Behavioral autonomy was unrelated to self-care but predicted better glycemic control for females.

It is also unproven that challenging work in a demanding environment usually brings long-term health risks; on the contrary, individual strivings for accomplishment and persistent dedication to one's career or community often are associated with sizeable health benefits. Overall, a substantial body of recent research reveals that conscientiousness plays a very significant role in health, with implications across the lifespan.

We applied single- and multiphase growth models to up to 25-year longitudinal data from 1,641 now-deceased participants of the national German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP; age at death: M = 74 years; SD = 14; 49\% women). Results revealed that perceiving more personal control over one’s life was related to subsequently higher late-life well-being, less severe rates of late-life declines, and a later onset of terminal decline. Associations were independent of key predictors of mortality, including age, gender, SES, and disability.

Method: In the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) national sample (N = 6,135; age = 25 to 75 years), we tested whether stronger beliefs of control over one’s life would moderate the effect of education on 14-year mortality risk. Results: Proportional hazards modeling indicated that both current levels of education and control beliefs were associated with lower risk of dying, over and above childhood socioeconomic level. In addition, there was a significant interaction between education and control beliefs. Among those low in education, higher control beliefs were associated with a decreased mortality risk. However, at greater levels of education, control beliefs were not associated with mortality risk. This effect remained after adjusting for potential confounding variables, including health behaviors, depressed affect, and general health (chronic illnesses, functional limitations, and self-rated health).

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate the links between naturalistically observed conflict, self-reported caregiver−youth conflict, and youth asthma symptoms. Method: Fifty-four youth with asthma (age range: 10–17 years) wore the Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR) for a 4-day period to assess interpersonal conflict and caregiver−youth conflict as they occur in daily life. Conflict also was assessed with baseline self-report questionnaires and daily diaries completed by youth participants and their caregivers. Asthma symptoms were assessed using daily diaries, baseline self-reports, and wheezing, as coded from the EAR. Results: EAR-observed measures of conflict were strongly associated with self-reported asthma symptoms (both baseline and daily diaries) and wheezing coded from the EAR. Further, when entered together in regression analyses, youth daily reports of negative caregiver−youth interactions and EAR-observed conflict uniquely predicted asthma symptoms; only EAR-observed conflict was associated with EAR-observed wheezing. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate the potential impact of daily conflict on youth asthma symptoms and the importance of assessing conflict as it occurs in everyday life. More broadly, they point to the importance of formulating a clear picture of family interactions outside of the lab, which is essential for understanding how family relationships “get under the skin” to affect youth health.},

Within a 5-factor personality-trait framework, teacher assessments of child personality were rationally and empirically aligned to establish similar factor structures across samples. Comparable items related to adult self-rated health, education, and alcohol use were harmonized, and data were pooled on harmonized items. A structural model was estimated as a multigroup analysis. Harmonized child personality factors were then used to examine markers of physiological dysfunction in the Hawaii sample and mortality risk in the Terman sample. Harmonized conscientiousness predicted less physiological dysfunction in the Hawaii sample and lower mortality risk in the Terman sample. These results illustrate how collaborative, integrative work with multiple samples offers the exciting possibility that samples from different cohorts and ages can be linked together to directly test life span theories of personality and health.

Enhancing guidance-related features and structure to existing OHCs could provide greater opportunity for effective diabetes self-management support.

Credit scoring has been so successful that it has expanded beyond lending and into our everyday lives, even to inform how insurers evaluate our health. The pervasive application of credit scoring has outpaced knowledge about why credit scores are such useful indicators of individual behavior. Here we test if the same factors that lead to poor credit scores also lead to poor health. Following the Dunedin (New Zealand) Longitudinal Study cohort of 1,037 study members, we examined the association between credit scores and cardiovascular disease risk and the underlying factors that account for this association. We find that credit scores are negatively correlated with cardiovascular disease risk. Variation in household income was not sufficient to account for this association. Rather, individual differences in human capital factors—educational attainment, cognitive ability, and self-control—predicted both credit scores and cardiovascular disease risk and accounted for ∼45\% of the correlation between credit scores and cardiovascular disease risk. Tracing human capital factors back to their childhood antecedents revealed that the characteristic attitudes, behaviors, and competencies children develop in their first decade of life account for a significant portion (∼22\%) of the link between credit scores and cardiovascular disease risk at midlife. We discuss the implications of these findings for policy debates about data privacy, financial literacy, and early childhood interventions.},

We propose the Life Course of Personality Model (LCP Model), which comprises a series of hypotheses that suggest how such mediational chains are subject to 2 sources of contingency. First, the mechanisms by which C translates into health and the avoidance of risk change from early childhood to late adulthood, involving processes that are specific to phases of the life course; also, however, C influences health by way of continuous processes extending over many decades of life. Second, C may be more consequential in some social contexts than in others, and when accompanied by some constellations of personality characteristics than by others. That is, the mediational processes by which C translates into health and the avoidance of disease are likely moderated by timing, social context (including the C of others), and other aspects of the individual’s personality. We consider methodological implications of the LCP Model.},

Combined with the low power of most current work, this often leads to the use of misleading criteria about whether an effect has replicated. Rosenthal (1990) suggested more appropriate criteria, here labeled the continuously cumulating meta-analytic (CCMA) approach. For example, a CCMA analysis on a replication attempt that does not reach significance might nonetheless provide more, not less, evidence that the effect is real. Alternatively, measures of heterogeneity might show that two studies that differ in whether they are significant might have only trivially different effect sizes. We present a nontechnical introduction to the CCMA framework (referencing relevant software), and then explain how it can be used to address aspects of replicability or more generally to assess quantitative evidence from numerous studies. We then present some examples and simulation results using the CCMA approach that show how the combination of evidence can yield improved results over the consideration of single studies.},

However, research on the ways that children and adolescents cope with cancer-related stress has not yielded clear findings on the efficacy of different coping strategies, and has been limited by reliance primarily on self-reports of both coping and distress. To address this gap, the current study used a control-based model of coping to examine self- and parent reports of child/adolescent coping and symptoms of anxiety and depression in a sample of children with cancer. Method: Children and adolescents (5 to 17 years old) and their parents were recruited near the time of a child’s diagnosis or relapse of cancer (M = 1.30 months postdiagnosis). Child self-reports (n = 153), mother reports (n = 297), and father reports (n = 161) of children’s coping and symptoms of anxiety/depression were obtained. Results: Bivariate correlations revealed significant associations for secondary control coping (efforts to adapt to source of stress; e.g., acceptance, cognitive reappraisal) and disengagement coping (e.g., avoidance, denial) with anxiety/depression within and across informants. Linear multiple regression analyses indicated that secondary control coping accounted for unique variance in symptoms of anxiety/depression both within and across informants. Conclusions: Secondary control coping appears important for children and adolescents during early phases of treatment for cancer, and it may serve as an important target for future interventions to enhance adjustment in these children.},

The causal links, however, are complex and not well elaborated. Many extant studies have used comparable measures for conscientiousness, and a systematic endeavor to build cross-study analyses for conscientiousness and health now seems feasible. Of particular interest are efforts to construct new, more comprehensive causal models by linking findings and combining data from existing studies of different cohorts. Although methodological perils can threaten such integration, such efforts offer an early opportunity to enliven a life course perspective on conscientiousness, to see whether component facets of conscientiousness remain related to each other and to relevant mediators across broad spans of time, and to bolster the findings of the few long-term longitudinal studies of the dynamics of personality and health. A promising approach to testing new models involves pooling data from extant studies as an efficient and heuristic prelude to large-scale testing of interventions.

Findings supported convergence and divergence in parent- and self-reports. Potential utility of informant discrepancies also emerged, such that discrepancies on trait disagreeableness and trait compulsivity predicted youth externalizing problems using the SDS approach and the polynomial regression approach; however, the polynomial regression approach yielded a more complex and nuanced characterization of informant discrepancies than did the SDS approach. Taken together, these results suggest that polynomial regressions may provide a more comprehensive picture regarding the meaning and utility of informant discrepancies.},

A paradox for human adolescence is why, during a time when the individual is probably faster, stronger, of higher reasoning capacity, and more resistant to disease, there is such an increase in mortality relative to childhood. This is due not to disease but, rather, to preventable forms of death (accidental fatalities, suicide, and homicide) associated with adolescents putting themselves in harm’s way, in part because of diminished self-control—the ability to suppress inappropriate emotions, desires, and actions.

We found that both endpoints were positively predicted by Conscientiousness and negatively predicted by Extraversion and Openness.

To illustrate these developments, this article describes socialization and preferences for mates as two important areas of gender research. We also highlight developing research trends that address the interactive processes by which nature and nurture work together in producing sex differences and similarities.

Methods: Sixty-three MCI and 90 control subjects were asked to describe their current personality traits by the Structured Interview for the Five-Factor Model (SIFFM). For each subject, a close relative retrospectively assessed these descriptions both as to the previous and current personality traits, using the Revised NEO Personality Inventory, Form R (NEO-PI-R). Results: Self-assessed MCI subjects reported significantly lower scores in the openness dimension than control subjects [F(1, 150) = 9.84, p = 0.002, ηp2 = 0.06]. In current observer ratings, MCI subjects had higher scores on neuroticism [F(1, 137) = 7.55, p = 0.007, ηp2 = 0.05] and lower ones on extraversion [F(1, 137) = 6.40, p = 0.013, ηp2 = 0.04], openness [F(1, 137) = 9.93, p = 0.002, ηp2 = 0.07], agreeableness [F(1, 137) = 10.18, p = 0.002, ηp2 = 0.07] and conscientiousness [F(1, 137) = 25.96, p {\textless} 0.001, ηp2 = 0.16].

We present work on using a crowdsourcing methodology to build a large corpus of postings on Twitter that have been shared by individuals diagnosed with clinical depression. Next, we develop a probabilistic model trained on this corpus to determine if posts could indicate depression. The model leverages signals of social activity, emotion, and language manifested on Twitter. Using the model, we introduce a social media depression index that may serve to characterize levels of depression in populations. Geographical, demographic and seasonal patterns of depression given by the measure confirm psychiatric findings and correlate highly with depression statistics reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).},

	abstract = {Objective: Although it is now widely accepted that dementia has a long preclinical phase during which neuropathology accumulates and cognition declines, little is known about the relation of neuropathology with the longitudinal rate of change in cognition among older persons without dementia. We quantified the burden of the neuropathologies of the three most common causes of dementia [i.e., Alzheimer’s disease (AD), cerebrovascular disease (CVD), and Lewy body disease (LBD)] and examined their relation with cognitive decline in a large cohort of persons without dementia proximate to death. Methods: A total of 467 deceased participants without dementia from two longitudinal clinical-pathologic studies, Rush Memory and Aging Project and Religious Orders Study, completed a mean of 7 annual evaluations including 17 cognitive tests. Neuropathologic examinations provided quantitative measures of AD (i.e., amyloid load, tangle density), CVD (i.e., macroscopic infarcts, microinfarcts), and neocortical Lewy bodies. Random coefficient models were used to examine the relation of the neuropathologies with rates of global cognitive decline as well as decline in four specific cognitive systems. Results: At autopsy, 82\% of persons without dementia had amyloid, 100\% had tangles, 29\% had macroscopic infarcts, 25\% had microinfarcts, and 6\% had neocortical Lewy bodies. Global cognition declined a mean of 0.034 unit per year (SE = 0.003, p {\textless} 0.001). In separate analyses, amyloid, tangles (p-values {\textless}0.001) and neocortical Lewy bodies (p = 0.015) were associated with an increased rate of global cognitive decline; macroscopic infarcts and microinfarcts were not. Further, when analyzed simultaneously, amyloid, tangles, and neocortical Lewy bodies remained associated with global cognitive decline (p-values {\textless}0.024). Finally, measures of AD were associated with decline in three of four systems, including episodic memory (i.e., tangles), semantic memory (i.e., amyloid and tangles), and working memory (i.e., amyloid). Lewy bodies also were associated with decline in three of four systems (i.e., semantic memory, working memory, and perceptual speed). Interpretation: The neuropathologies of the common causes of dementia, particularly AD and neocortical LBD, are associated with decline in multiple cognitive abilities among older persons without dementia.},

We tested the hypothesis that these pathologic indices account for the majority of late life cognitive decline. A total of 856 deceased participants from 2 longitudinal clinical–pathologic studies, Rush Memory and Aging Project and Religious Orders Study, completed a mean of 7.5 annual evaluations, including 17 cognitive tests. Neuropathologic examinations provided quantitative measures of global Alzheimer pathology, amyloid load, tangle density, macroscopic infarcts, microinfarcts, and neocortical Lewy bodies. Random coefficient models were used to examine the linear relation of pathologic indices with global cognitive decline. In subsequent analyses, random change point models were used to examine the relation of the pathologic indices with the onset of terminal decline and rates of preterminal and terminal decline (ie, nonlinear decline). Cognition declined a mean of about 0.11U per year (estimate = −0.109, standard error [SE] = 0.004, p {\textless} 0.001), with significant individual differences in rates of decline; the variance estimate for the individual slopes was 0.013 (SE = 0.112, p {\textless} 0.001). In separate analyses, global Alzheimer pathology, amyloid, tangles, macroscopic infarcts, and neocortical Lewy bodies were associated with faster rates of decline and explained 22\%, 6\%, 34\%, 2\%, and 8\% of the variation in decline, respectively. When analyzed simultaneously, the pathologic indices accounted for a total of 41\% of the variation in decline, and the majority remained unexplained. Furthermore, in random change point models examining the influence of the pathologic indices on the onset of terminal decline and the preterminal and terminal components of the cognitive trajectory, the common pathologic indices accounted for less than a third of the variation in the onset of terminal decline and rates of preterminal and terminal decline. The pathologic indices of the common causes of dementia are important determinants of cognitive decline in old age and account for a large proportion of the variation in late life cognitive decline. Surprisingly, however, much of the variation in cognitive decline remains unexplained, suggesting that other important determinants of cognitive decline remain to be identified. Identification of the mechanisms that contribute to the large unexplained proportion of cognitive decline is urgently needed to prevent late life cognitive decline. Ann Neurol 2013;74:478–489},

The current study aimed to establish whether C moderates the relationship between daily hassle appraisals, daily affect, and physical symptoms. A daily diary design was used, where participants (N = 103) completed a baseline measure of C followed by a 14-day daily diary, providing daily details of hassles (primary and secondary appraisals) experienced as well as positive and negative affect and physical symptoms. Hierarchical linear modelling revealed that Total C (as well as two facets of C: Order and Industriousness) moderated the relationship between stress appraisals and positive affect. Specifically, the negative association between the daily appraisal of hassles as stressful (i.e., where perceived demands outweighed perceived resources) and positive affect was stronger for lower and average levels of C, Order, and Industriousness. No significant moderated effects were found for negative affect or physical symptoms. The Order facet was also found to be an important factor predicting attrition. The current study provided evidence that C and two of its facets can moderate the relationship between hassle appraisal and positive affect. C may exert part of its influence on health by modifying the effects of daily stressors. What is already known on this subject? Conscientiousness has a significant positive effect on longevity and health status. While the performance of health behaviours may partially account for this relationship, evidence suggests that it does not fully mediate the effect. Research has begun to look at stress as a possible additional explanatory variable, and there is evidence that Conscientiousness moderates the relationship between stress and health behaviours.

	abstract = {Psychology has historically been concerned, first and foremost, with explaining the causal mechanisms that give rise to behavior. Randomized, tightly controlled experiments are enshrined as the gold standard of psychological research, and there are endless investigations of the various mediating and moderating variables that govern various behaviors. We argue that psychology’s near-total focus on explaining the causes of behavior has led much of the field to be populated by research programs that provide intricate theories of psychological mechanism but that have little (or unknown) ability to predict future behaviors with any appreciable accuracy. We propose that principles and techniques from the field of machine learning can help psychology become a more predictive science. We review some of the fundamental concepts and tools of machine learning and point out examples where these concepts have been used to conduct interesting and important psychological research that focuses on predictive research questions. We suggest that an increased focus on prediction, rather than explanation, can ultimately lead us to greater understanding of behavior.},

	abstract = {Diabetes is a chronic disease that, regardless of type, requires intensive, ongoing self-management. As a result, people with diabetes (PWD) often have complex environmental, social, behavioral, and informational needs, many of which are unmet in healthcare settings and systems. To help meet these needs, many PWD interact with diabetes online communities (DOCs), including platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and blogs, to share real-life support, problems, and concerns with other PWD, offering a rich source of data on patient-reported outcomes. This article reviews recent psychosocial needs and outcomes identified by studies of DOCs and/or their users. Participation in DOCs appears driven by a need for psychosocial support, unmet by providers and the healthcare system, as well as a sense of duty to provide it to others. The most common activities observed in DOCs are giving and receiving various types of support: psychosocial, technical, informational, and self-management. General and specific challenges (e.g., continuous glucose monitoring) as well as frustrations and worries associated with those challenges are commonly expressed, leading to reciprocal sharing, support, and encouragement, in a judgment-free manner, from other PWD. This leads users to feel more understood, empowered, validated, less alone, and more supported. Negative findings were reported very rarely and focused more on how other participants used social media rather than on the exchange of misplaced or dangerous information or advice. Diabetes online communities have grown from unmet needs for problem-solving and psychosocial support for living with a complex condition and from the availability of a new communications medium (i.e., social media). This has enabled communities of peers to both seek and receive support for living with diabetes, providing an important supplement to what is provided in healthcare settings and offering valuable information about what is most important to PWD and their families, with the potential to improve psychosocial care.},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of the study was to describe outcomes that matter to teens with type 1 diabetes. Understanding outcomes that matter to teens could support successful interventions to improve diabetes self-management. Methods Fifty publicly available posts published in the "teen" sections of 2 major diabetes online forums between 2011 and 2013 were analyzed using qualitative research methods. From each post, content and descriptive data (eg, duration of diabetes and age) were collected. Two members of the research team independently used open coding techniques to identify outcomes (defined as impacts or consequences of type 1 diabetes) and organized them into themes and subthemes. A codebook was jointly developed to facilitate the identification of meaningful outcomes from the posts. Results Teens' average age was 15.7 years, and the average time since diabetes diagnosis was 6.3 years. The 3 most commonly mentioned outcomes were (1) interactions with peers ("I want to talk to someone who understands"), (2) emotional well-being ("Diabetes makes me want to cry"), and (3) blood glucose management ("My blood sugar never goes down"). Other identified outcomes included (4) physical well-being, (5) education and motivation of others, (6) family interactions, (7) academic achievement, and (8) interactions with important others such as teachers. Conclusions While teens are concerned about control of their blood glucose, there are many other outcomes that matter to them. Health care providers and diabetes educators may want to consider these other outcomes when motivating teens with type 1 diabetes to improve blood glucose control.},

New qualitative research underscores the fact that this “support” transcends mental health concerns, to actually provide patients with important practical tips and tricks for diabetes self-care, and product selection/decision-making information from peers. Netnography is an emerging methodology that applies an ethnographic research approach to studying activity on the social web. Researchers embed themselves in the online environment to take an observational “deep dive” into online conversations to identify themes, sentiments, and perceptions. Using this methodology in summer 2017, a team of researchers captured and analyzed hundreds of diabetes-related posts on prominent platforms Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Tumblr, Pinterest, Reddit, and Quora. Our team identified 6 major trends, or “life themes,” in diabetes patient social media, providing insights into patient sentiments and needs. A topology of social media channels emerged, indicating which platforms are used most often for each life theme. Findings indicate that social media provides a significant source not only of moral support and camaraderie, but also critical education on thriving with diabetes. Importantly, we observed strong evidence of peer influence on patients’ therapy and diabetes technology purchasing decisions.},

	abstract = {Objective: This systematic review aims to assess the use and implementation of the Behavioral Model of Health Services Use developed by Ronald M. Andersen in recent studies explicity using this model. Methods: A systematic search was conducted using PubMed in April 2011. The search strategy aimed to identify all articles in which the Andersen model had been applied and which had been published between 1998 and March 2011 in English or German. The search yielded a total of 328 articles. Two researchers independently reviewed the retrieved articles for possible inclusion using a three-step selection process (1. title/author, 2. abstract, 3. full text) with pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria for each step. 16 studies met all of the inclusion criteria and were used for analysis. A data extraction form was developed to collect information from articles on 17 categories including author, title, population description, aim of the study, methodological approach, use of the Andersen model, applied model version, and main results. The data collected were collated into six main categories and are presented accordingly. Results: Andersen’s Behavioral Model (BM) has been used extensively in studies investigating the use of health services. The studies identified for this review showed that the model has been used in several areas of the health care system and in relation to very different diseases. The 1995 version of the BM was the version most frequently applied in the studies. However, the studies showed substantial differences in the variables used. The majority of the reviewed studies included age (N=15), marital status (N=13), gender/sex (N=12), education (N=11), and ethnicity (N=10) as predisposing factors and income/financial situation (N=10), health insurance (N=9), and having a usual source of care/family doctor (N=9) as enabling factors. As need factors, most of the studies included evaluated health status (N=13) and self-reported/perceived health (N=9) as well as a very wide variety of diseases. Although associations were found between the main factors examined in the studies and the utilization of health care, there was a lack of consistency in these findings. The context of the studies reviewed and the characteristics of the study populations seemed to have a strong impact on the existence, strength and direction of these associations. Conclusions: Although the frequently used BM was explicitly employed as the theoretical background for the reviewed studies, their operationalizations of the model revealed that only a small common set of variables was used and that there were huge variations in the way these variables were categorized, especially as it concerns predisposing and enabling factors. This may stem from the secondary data sets used in the majority of the studies, which limited the variables available for study. Primary studies are urgently needed to enrich our understanding of health care utilization and the complexity of the processes shown in the BM.},

Daily stress and daily negative affect were modeled using 1,012 subjects from the National Study of Daily Events (NSDE), an 8-day daily diary study. Age ranged from 25 to 74. Data were modeled using within-person HLM techniques. Daily stress and neuroticism interacted in their effect on daily negative affect. There was a stronger association between daily stress and negative affect for persons high in neuroticism as compared to those low on the trait. In addition, daily stress and age interacted in their effect on daily negative affect. There was a stronger association between daily stress and negative affect for older as compared to younger adults. Results suggest heightened reactivity to stressors in older adulthood, perhaps due to kindling effects. Changes in the aging brain may explain this effect.

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: To examine whether cognitive and psychosocial factors predict mortality once physical health is controlled. DESIGN: A prospective study of community dwelling elderly. Mortality was assessed over a period of 3-4 years after the baseline assessment of predictors. The data were analysed using the Cox proportional hazards model. SETTING: Canberra and Queanbeyan, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 897 people aged 70 or over and living in the community, drawn from the compulsory electoral roll. RESULTS: For the sample as a whole, the significant predictors of mortality were male sex, poor physical health, poor cognitive functioning, and low neuroticism. Men had an adjusted relative risk of mortality of 2.5 compared with women. For the male sub-sample, poor self rated health and a poor performance on a speeded cognitive task were significant predictors, while for women, greater disability, low systolic blood pressure, and a low score on a dementia screening test were the strongest predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality was predicted by physical ill health and poor cognitive functioning. Psychosocial factors such as socioeconomic status, psychiatric symptoms, and social support did not add to the prediction of mortality, once sex, physical health, and cognitive functioning were controlled. Mortality among men was more than twice that of women, even when adjusted for other predictors.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Following up on growing evidence that higher levels of conscientiousness are associated with greater health protection, the authors conducted a meta-analysis of the association between conscientiousness-related traits and longevity. DESIGN: Using a random-effects analysis model, the authors statistically combined 20 independent samples. In addition, the authors used fixed-effects analyses to examine specific facets of conscientiousness and study characteristics as potential moderators of this relationship. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Effect sizes were computed for each individual sample as the correlation coefficient r, based on the relationship between conscientiousness and mortality risk (all-cause mortality risk, longevity, or length of survival). RESULTS: Higher levels of conscientiousness were significantly and positively related to longevity (r = .11, 95\% confidence interval = .05-.17). Associations were strongest for the achievement (persistent, industrious) and order (organized, disciplined) facets of conscientiousness. CONCLUSION: Results strongly support the importance of conscientiousness-related traits to health across the life span. Future research and interventions should consider how individual differences in conscientiousness may cause and be shaped by health-relevant biopsychosocial events across many years.},

	abstract = {Personality–outcome associations, typically represented using the Big Five personality domains, are ubiquitous, but often weak and possibly driven by the constituents of these domains. We hypothesized that representing the associations using personality questionnaire items (as markers for personality nuances) could increase prediction strength. Using the National Child Development Study (N = 8719), we predicted 40 diverse outcomes from both the Big Five domains and their 50 items. Models were trained (using penalized regression) and applied for prediction in independent sample partitions (with 100 permutations). Item models tended to out‐predict Big Five models (explaining on average 30\% more variance), regardless of outcomes' independently rated breadth versus behavioural specificity. Moreover, the predictive power of Big Five domains per se was at least partly inflated by the unique variance of their constituent items, especially for generally more predictable outcomes. Removing the Big Five variance from items marginally reduced their predictive power. These findings are consistent with the possibility that the associations of personality with outcomes often pertain to (potentially large numbers of) specific behavioural, cognitive, affective, and motivational characteristics represented by single questionnaire items rather than to the broader (underlying) traits that these items are ostensibly indicators of. This may also have implications for personality‐based interventions. Copyright © 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology},

	abstract = {AIM: Little is known about the influence of the personality of the child and the personalities of the child's parents on glycaemic control in Type 1 diabetes. Our objective was to examine the extent to which glycaemic control is associated with the child's and the parents' stable personality traits, using the Big Five personality model as the basic framework. METHODS: Participants were 64 children (aged 6-16 years) with recent-onset Type 1 diabetes and their parents. Glycaemic control (HbA(1c)) was assessed at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years after diagnosis; personality was assessed at 4-6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year after diagnosis. Associations of personality with mean HbA(1c) over 2 years were examined. RESULTS: Children with better glycaemic control had a personality pattern of high Agreeableness, high Conscientiousness and low Neuroticism. Mothers of children with better glycaemic control showed a similar personality pattern, whereas the personality of the father was only marginally related to glycaemic control. Children's Conscientiousness and mothers' Agreeableness together predicted 18\% of the variability in mean HbA(1c). All associations were unchanged when we controlled for child's age. CONCLUSIONS: Glycaemic control in the child was associated with the same child and maternal personality characteristics that influence treatment adherence, health-promoting behaviours and general adjustment in adult populations. In future, studies are needed to examine attitudinal and behavioural mediators of this relationship. It is suggested that attention to the personalities of the child and the mother can help to tailor diabetes education to the individual child.},

In addition, interactions among the Big 5 were tested to provide a more accurate understanding of how personality traits may influence an inflammatory biomarker. Data included 1054 participants in the Midlife Development in the U.S. (MIDUS) biomarkers subproject. The Big 5 personality traits were assessed in 2005-2006 as part of the main MIDUS survey. Medication use, comorbid conditions, smoking behavior, alcohol use, body mass index, and serum levels of IL-6 were assessed in 2005-2009 as part of the biomarkers subproject. Linear regression analyses examined personality associations with IL-6. A significant Conscientiousness*Neuroticism interaction revealed that those high in both Conscientiousness and Neuroticism had lower circulating IL-6 levels than people with all other configurations of Conscientiousness and Neuroticism. Adjustment for health behaviors diminished the magnitude of this association but did not eliminate it, suggesting that lower comorbid conditions and obesity may partly explain the lower inflammation of those high in both Conscientiousness and Neuroticism. Our findings suggest, consistent with prior speculation, that average to higher levels of Neuroticism can in some cases be associated with health benefits - in this case when it is accompanied by high Conscientiousness. Using personality to identify those at risk may lead to greater personalization in the prevention and remediation of chronic inflammation.},

Day-to-day within-person effects of daily hassles on health behaviors were examined, together with the influence of conscientiousness. RESULTS: Using hierarchical multivariate linear modeling, the results showed that conscientiousness was associated with lower consumption of high-fat snacks and more fruit and higher caffeine intake and smoking (in smokers) across the 28-day study period. Facets of conscientiousness were also found to moderate the effects of daily hassles on vegetable consumption, smoking, and likelihood of exercising each day. Participants with higher levels of order exercised more on days when they experienced daily hassles, whereas participants with lower levels of self-efficacy consumed less vegetables on stressful days. Among smokers, those with higher levels of self-discipline reported smoking more on days when they encountered hassles. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that conscientiousness and its facets may influence health status directly via changes in health behaviors and indirectly through influencing stress-health behavior relations.},

Understanding the health status and needs of immigrants is important because of their growing numbers and their contribution to the health of the nation, but it is challenging because of gaps in national databases, the heterogeneity of immigrant populations, and uncertainty about how migration affects health. Healthy People 2010 outlines the nation's public health objectives for the current decade. It includes ten leading health indicators (LHIs) chosen because of their importance as public health issues, their ability to motivate action, and the availability of data to measure their progress. In this paper, we discuss the health of immigrants from the perspective of these LHIs, as they provide a framework for anticipating some of the future health needs of immigrants and help define priority areas for research and action.},

	abstract = {Canada admits between more than 200,000 immigrants every year. National policy emphasizes rigorous selection to ensure that Canada admits healthy immigrants. However, remarkably little policy is directed to ensuring that they stay healthy. This neglect is wrong-headed: keeping new settlers healthy is just, humane, and consistent with national self-interest. By identifying personal vulnerabilities, salient resettlement stressors that act alone or interact with predisposition in order to create health risk, and the personal and social resources that reduce risk and promote well-being, health research can enlighten policy and practice. However, the paradigms that have dominated immigrant health research over the past 100 years–the “sick” and “healthy immigrant,” respectively–have been inadequate. Part of the problem is that socio-political controversy has influenced the questions asked about immigrant health, and the manner of their investigation. Beginning with a review of studies that point out the shortcomings of the sick immigrant and healthy immigrant paradigms, this article argues that an interaction model that takes into account both predisposition and socio-environmental factors, provides the best explanatory framework for extant findings, and the best guide for future research. Finally, the article argues that forging stronger links between research, policy and the delivery of services will not only help make resettlement a more humane process, it will help ensure that Canada benefits from the human capital that its newest settlers bring with them.},

During 444,770 person-years at risk, 3,947 participants (54.4\% women) died (mean age at baseline = 50.9 years; mean follow-up = 5.9 years). Only low conscientiousness-reflecting low persistence, poor self-control, and lack of long-term planning-was associated with elevated mortality risk when taking into account age, sex, ethnicity/nationality, and all 5 personality traits. Individuals in the lowest tertile of conscientiousness had a 1.4 times higher risk of death (hazard ratio = 1.37, 95\% confidence interval: 1.18, 1.58) compared with individuals in the top 2 tertiles. This association remained after further adjustment for health behaviors, marital status, and education. In conclusion, of the higher-order personality traits measured by the five-factor model, only conscientiousness appears to be related to mortality risk across populations.},

People lower in agreeableness, neuroticism, and openness to experience during high school were more likely to enter the military after graduation. In addition, military training was associated with changes in personality. Compared with a control group, military recruits had lower levels of agreeableness after training. These levels persisted 5 years after training, even after participants entered college or the labor market. This study is one of the first to identify life experiences associated with changes in personality traits.

	abstract = {The rising number of newly insured young adults brought on by health care reform will soon increase demands on primary care physicians. Physicians will face more young adult patients, which presents an opportunity for more prevention-oriented care. In the present study, we evaluated whether brief observer reports of young adults’ personality traits could predict which individuals would be at greater risk for poor health as they entered midlife. Following the cohort of 1,000 individuals from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (Moffitt, Caspi, Rutter, \& Silva, 2001), we show that very brief measures of young adults’ personalities predicted their midlife physical health across multiple domains (metabolic abnormalities, cardiorespiratory fitness, pulmonary function, periodontal disease, and systemic inflammation). Individuals scoring low on the traits of Conscientiousness and Openness to Experience went on to develop poorer health even after accounting for preexisting differences in education, socioeconomic status, smoking, obesity, self-reported health, medical conditions, and family medical history. Moreover, personality ratings from peer informants who knew participants well, and from a nurse and receptionist who had just met participants for the first time, predicted health decline from young adulthood to midlife despite striking differences in level of acquaintance. Personality effect sizes were on par with other well-established health risk factors such as socioeconomic status, smoking, and self-reported health. We discuss the potential utility of personality measurement to function as an inexpensive and accessible tool for health care professionals to personalize preventive medicine. Adding personality information to existing health care electronic infrastructures could also advance personality theory by generating opportunities to examine how personality processes influence doctor–patient communication, health service use, and patient outcomes.},

Methods: Members of the Hawaii Personality and Health Cohort (N = 753; 368 men, 385 women) underwent a medical examination at mean age 51. Their global health status was evaluated by well-established clinical indicators that were objectively measured using standard protocols, including blood pressure, lipid profile, fasting blood glucose, and body mass index. These indicators were combined to evaluate overall physiological dysregulation and grouped into five more homogeneous subcomponents (glucose intolerance, blood pressure, lipids, obesity, and medications).

Personality processes are mechanisms that unfold over time to produce the effects of personality traits.

These mechanisms are illustrated here by a selection of studies of traits representing the three broad domains of personality and temperament: negative emotionality, positive emotionality, and constraint. Personality processes are studied over the short term, as in event-sampling studies, and over the long term, as in lifespan research. Implications of findings from the study of processes are considered for resolving issues in models of personality structure, improving and extending methods of personality assessment, and identifying targets for personality interventions.},

The Midlife Development in the United States Survey, a nationally representative sample of 3032 adults ages 25-74, was used to determine the association between the five-factor traits of personality and common mental and physical disorders. Findings are consistent with and extend previous results showing that conscientiousness is associated with significantly reduced likelihood of a wide range of mental and physical disorders among adults in the general population, and inversely that neuroticism is associated with increased rates. Among adults with physical illnesses, associations were found between personality and likelihood of physical limitations, especially conscientiousness. These findings provide a framework upon which research on complex causal processes may proceed. Thus future research attention might profitably be directed to conscientiousness-relevant processes, such as adherence to health and treatment recommendations and internalization of healthy societal norms for sensible health-related behavior.},

In particular, this article develops the heuristic strategy of simultaneously comparing several emotional aspects of personality and several diseases, with close attention to the strength of the links between personality and disease. The published literature on personality correlates of five diseases with so-called "psychosomatic" components—asthma, arthritis, ulcers, headaches, and coronary heart disease—is reviewed and discussed, with a focus on construct validity. The statistical technique of meta-analysis is used to provide an easily viewed comparative summary. The results point to the probable existence of a generic "disease-prone" personality that involves depression, anger/hostility, anxiety, and possibly other aspects of personality. However, except in the case of coronary heart disease, the evidence is weak. Nevertheless, there is sufficient evidence to argue for a key role for psychological research on the prevention and treatment of disease. Specific directions for future research are described.

We provide an overview of personality for health scientists, using the primary organizing framework used in the study of personality and longevity. We then review data on various aspects of personality linked to longevity. In general, there is good evidence that higher level of conscientiousness and lower levels of hostility and Type D or "distressed" personality are associated with greater longevity. Limited evidence suggests that extraversion, openness, perceived control, and low levels of emotional suppression may be associated with longer lifespan. Findings regarding neuroticism are mixed, supporting the notion that many component(s) of neuroticism detract from life expectancy, but some components at some levels may be healthy or protective. Overall, evidence suggests various personality traits are significant predictors of longevity and points to several promising directions for further study. We conclude by discussing the implications of these links for epidemiologic research and personalized medicine and lay out a translational research agenda for integrating the psychology of individual differences into public health and medicine.},

Data sources were located by combining conscientiousness-related terms and relevant health-related behavior terms in database searches as well as by retrieving dissertations and requesting unpublished data from electronic mailing lists. The resulting database contained 194 studies that were quantitatively synthesized. Results showed that conscientiousness-related traits were negatively related to all risky health-related behaviors and positively related to all beneficial health-related behaviors.

C was significantly associated with coronary death and total mortality after adjustment for N and the other variables listed above, and relative risks of 1.4 to 1.6 were observed for all endpoints. These results support the idea that neuroticism is not associated with major causes of mortality, but that cynicism is associated with several causes.

Accounts were coded for 3 narrative themes: closure, redemption, and contamination. Psychological well-being was significantly related to accounts that were high in closure and national redemption and, among those more directly exposed to the attacks, accounts high in redemptive imagery. Psychological distress was significantly related to accounts that were low in closure and high in themes of personal contamination.

	abstract = {Objective: Diabetes is an increasingly important public health concern, but little is known about the contribution of psychological factors on diabetes risk. We examined whether personality is associated with risk of incident diabetes and diabetes-related mortality. Method: An individual-participant meta-analysis of 34,913 adults free of diabetes at baseline (average age 53.7 years, 57\% women) from 5 prospective cohort studies from the United States and United Kingdom. Personality dimensions included extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience based on the Five Factor Model. Results: During an average follow-up of 5.7 years, 1845 participants became diabetic. Of the 5 personality dimensions, only low conscientiousness was associated with an elevated diabetes risk (OR = 0.87, 95\% CI = 0.82–0.91 per 1 standard deviation increment in conscientiousness). This association attenuated by 60\% after adjustment for obesity and by 25\% after adjustment for physical inactivity. Low conscientiousness was also associated with elevated risk of diabetes mortality (HR = 0.72, CI = 0.53–0.98 per 1 standard deviation increment in conscientiousness). Other personality traits were not consistently associated with diabetes incidence or mortality. Conclusions: Low conscientiousness—a cognitive–behavioral disposition reflecting careless behavior and a lack of self-control and planning—is associated with elevated risk of diabetes and diabetes-related mortality. The underlying mechanisms are likely to involve health behaviors, such as poor weight management, physical inactivity, and adherence to medical management recommendations.

	abstract = {Background: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) improves glycemic control. Less than half of youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D) use CGM, with disparities among minority and low-income youth. The aim of this study was to determine if trial CGM use increases uptake of personal CGM.

Methods: T1D youth were provided sample CGM placement at the point of care, with CGM education and app setup. Follow-up calls at 5 and 10 days assessed CGM data, and desire to continue using CGM. Follow-up at 3–6 months recorded CGM use, CGM data, and A1c. Participants completed surveys at enrollment, 10 days, and 3 months. Differences were assessed between baseline and follow-up.

Results: Of the 26 enrolled participants with T1D, 15 were CGM naive, and 11 were prior CGM users. The mean age was 14.1 ± 2.9 years, 65\% male, 42\% were Black, 12\% were Hispanic, 65\% were on public insurance, and 43\% had household income of {\textless}\$50,000. The median duration of diabetes was 4.6 years (interquartile range 2.4–7.7), mean baseline A1c was 10.7\% ± 2.4\%. After trial CGM use, 85\% of participants reported wanting personal CGM, and at 3–6 months follow-up 76\% had obtained one and 43\% were using a personal CGM. There were no improvements in A1C or time in range, but participants reported an increase in the perceived benefits of CGM usage (4.0 vs. 4.3, p = 0.03).

Conclusions: Placing a sample CGM at the point of care can improve uptake of personal CGM and may help mitigate disparities in CGM use in minority and underserved youth. Long-term studies are needed to determine how similar interventions impact glycemic control and patient outcomes. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04721145},

	abstract = {The correlation between personality traits and health outcomes of primary prevention has been examined. However, there is a lack of evidence on the association between the assessment of personality traits and medication adherence for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Thus, this study aimed to explore the association between personality traits and medication adherence, including compliance to prescribed medications and attitudes toward taking medications among patients with cardiovascular disease. This cross-sectional study included patients hospitalized for cardiovascular disease. We assessed the Big Five personality traits (conscientiousness, neuroticism, openness, extraversion, and agreeableness) of each patient at discharge using the Ten-Item Personality Inventory. In addition, we evaluated four aspects of medication adherence using a 12-item version of the medication adherence scale: medication compliance, collaboration with health care providers, willingness to access and use information on medication, and acceptance to take medication. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the correlation between the level of each medication adherence domain and each personality trait. The data of 128 patients with cardiovascular disease were analyzed. Higher conscientiousness score was significantly associated with a high compliance score (odds ratio per 1 point increase, 1.90; 95\% confidence interval, 1.30–2.79; p = 0.001), high collaboration score (1.90; 1.31–2.76; p = 0.001), and high willingness score (1.74; 1.19–2.54; p = 0.004) after adjustment for potential confounders. Other combinations of personality traits and medication adherence showed no statistically significant correlations in multivariate analyses. The findings of this study suggest that assessment of personality traits, especially conscientiousness, may facilitate patient–medical staff communication for the improvement of medication adherence in patients with cardiovascular disease.},

	abstract = {Most theories and hypotheses in psychology are verbal in nature, yet their evaluation overwhelmingly relies on inferential statistical procedures. The validity of the move from qualitative to quantitative analysis depends on the verbal and statistical expressions of a hypothesis being closely aligned – that is, that the two must refer to roughly the same set of hypothetical observations. Here, I argue that many applications of statistical inference in psychology fail to meet this basic condition. Focusing on the most widely used class of model in psychology – the linear mixed model – I explore the consequences of failing to statistically operationalize verbal hypotheses in a way that respects researchers' actual generalization intentions. I demonstrate that although the “random effect” formalism is used pervasively in psychology to model intersubject variability, few researchers accord the same treatment to other variables they clearly intend to generalize over (e.g., stimuli, tasks, or research sites). The under-specification of random effects imposes far stronger constraints on the generalizability of results than most researchers appreciate. Ignoring these constraints can dramatically inflate false-positive rates, and often leads researchers to draw sweeping verbal generalizations that lack a meaningful connection to the statistical quantities they are putatively based on. I argue that failure to take the alignment between verbal and statistical expressions seriously lies at the heart of many of psychology's ongoing problems (e.g., the replication crisis), and conclude with a discussion of several potential avenues for improvement.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have produced general models that can perform complex tasks such as summarizing long passages and translating across languages. Here, we introduce a method to extract adjective similarities from language models as done with survey-based ratings in traditional psycholexical studies but using millions of times more text in a natural setting. The correlational structure produced through this method is highly similar to that of self- and other-ratings of 435 English terms reported by Saucier and Goldberg (1996a). The ﬁrst three unrotated factors produced using NLP are congruent with those in survey data, with coefﬁcients of 0.89, 0.79, and 0.79. This structure is robust to many modeling decisions: adjective set, including those with 1,710 (Goldberg, 1982) and 18,000 English terms (Allport \& Odbert, 1936); the query used to extract correlations; and language model. Notably, Neuroticism and Openness are only weakly and inconsistently recovered. This is a new source of signal that is closer to the original (semantic) vision of the lexical hypothesis. The method can be applied where surveys cannot: in dozens of languages simultaneously, with tens of thousands of items, on historical text, and at extremely large scale for little cost. The code is made public to facilitate reproduction and fast iteration in new directions of research.},

	abstract = {Recent research has demonstrated that the network measure node strength or sum of a node’s connections is roughly equivalent to confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) loadings. A key finding of this research is that node strength represents a combination of different latent causes. In the present research, we sought to circumvent this issue by formulating a network equivalent of factor loadings, which we call network loadings. In two simulations, we evaluated whether these network loadings could effectively (1) separate the effects of multiple latent causes and (2) estimate the simulated factor loading matrix of factor models. Our findings suggest that the network loadings can effectively do both. In addition, we leveraged the second simulation to derive effect size guidelines for network loadings. In a third simulation, we evaluated the similarities and differences between factor and network loadings when the data were generated from random, factor, and network models. We found sufficient differences between the loadings, which allowed us to develop an algorithm to predict the data generating model called the Loadings Comparison Test (LCT). The LCT had high sensitivity and specificity when predicting the data generating model. In sum, our results suggest that network loadings can provide similar information to factor loadings when the data are generated from a factor model and therefore can be used in a similar way (e.g., item selection, measurement invariance, factor scores).},

The present review examines methodologies suited to identify such symptom networks and discusses network analysis techniques that may be used to extract clinically and scientiﬁcally useful information from such networks (e.g., which symptom is most central in a person’s network). The authors also show how network analysis techniques may be used to construct simulation models that mimic symptom dynamics. Network approaches naturally explain the limited success of traditional research strategies, which are typically based on the idea that symptoms are manifestations of some common underlying factor, while offering promising methodological alternatives. In addition, these techniques may offer possibilities to guide and evaluate therapeutic interventions.},

	abstract = {This study examined how the COVID-19 pandemic affected sexual assault healthcare services in a predominately African American U.S. city. In mixed methods research design, we used quantitative interrupted time series modeling to evaluate changes in service rates for three core post-assault healthcare services—medical forensic exams (MFEs), medical advocacy MFE accompaniment, and counseling—from January 2019 through June 2021. We also conducted qualitative interviews with 12 sexual assault advocates to understand how their clients were impacted by COVID and how their agency adapted services to respond to the needs of their community. Both the quantitative and qualitative data revealed marked disruptions in service provision. The number of MFEs, medical advocacy accompaniments, and counseling sessions significantly decreased during the pandemic’s initial surge, and survivors feared seeking hospital-based health care due to concerns that they might contract COVID-19 in hospital emergency departments. The number of MFEs performed by program staff did not return to pre-pandemic levels during this study’s observation period, but the number of medical advocacy accompaniments and counseling sessions did significantly rebound. Counseling services eventually exceeded pre-pandemic levels as agency staff supported clients with both assault- and COVID-related trauma and loss. These results underscore the need for community-based sexual assault healthcare services, so that if public health emergencies limit the availability, accessibility, and safety of hospital emergency department care, sexual assault survivors have other settings for obtaining post-assault health care.},

	abstract = {To increase access to counseling and advocacy services and respond to changes in communication preferences, many victim service programs are expanding their traditional telephone hotlines and adding web chat or text hotlines. However, there is little research available about these web and text-based hotlines. We examined program data collected in the first year of operation of a web-based crisis hotline for sexual assault survivors at a large Midwestern university in the United States as part of a larger evaluation project. We examined how often the web-based chat hotline was used and explored patterns of use by time of day and month, comparing to records from the phone hotline operated by the same campus-based victim service program. We also conducted interviews and two group discussions with volunteers and staff about their experiences with providing crisis intervention in a web-chat medium. Findings suggest that the web-based crisis hotline is being used frequently, nearly as often as the telephone hotline and doubling the total number of crisis contacts the organization had in the year prior to adding the web-based chat hotline. Staff and volunteers identified a number of advantages of a web-based hotline, including increased privacy and accessibility for survivors. Difficulty identifying and conveying emotions in the web-chat context was one of the primary challenges described by staff and volunteers. Operating the web-hotline, therefore, requires additional training for volunteers and staff on how to translate crisis intervention skills into a text-based medium. Suggestions for how to communicate effectively in text-based crisis intervention are discussed, along with other considerations for designing a web or text hotline.},

Here, we present the results of two experiments in which participants completed two immediate free recall tasks, a verbal task involving words presented at a central location and a spatial task involving squares presented at different locations. Some participants were allowed to recall the words or locations spontaneously in any order they wished. But critically, to assess the degree to which the influence of space and time are under cognitive control, other participants were subtly biased toward temporal information, with an instruction to begin recall from the last presented item before recalling the rest of the items in any order they wished. Replicating recent work, all conditions showed clear evidence that recall was organized along both the temporal and the spatial dimensions. Extending this work, we found that the subtle change of recall instructions increased the reliance on temporal information in the spatial recall task. A set of correlational analyses suggest that spatial and temporal information do not compete when participants search memory spontaneously but do compete when instructions favor temporal information. These findings expand our understanding of how associative dimensions interact in memory and provide an important target for future theoretical modeling.},

	abstract = {Although research has examined disparities in suicidal ideation across multiple groups, few investigations have analyzed such disparities in the context of COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, there is limited research on differences within and across countries, further limiting the extent to which meaningful comparisons can be made. Therefore, this study examines risk and protective factors of suicidal ideation during COVID-19 lockdown in adults across five countries. Adults (N = 2,509) from the United States, Italy, Spain, Saudi Arabia, and India completed a survey to measure suicidal ideation, recent drug use, and sociodemographic factors. Prevalence of suicidal ideation was assessed using simple and multivariable logistic regression models, and severity of suicidal ideation was analyzed via a multinomial multivariable logistic regression. Cohen's d statistics were reported for all analyses to report effect size. In the United States subsample, racial/ethnic minorities endorsed a significantly greater prevalence of suicidal ideation compared to their White peers (aOR = 2.31, 95\% CI: 1.26–4.27, d = 0.46). However, no significant racial differences in suicidal ideation were found in other countries. Past 90-day illicit drug use was associated with greater prevalence (aOR = 1.38, 95\% CI: 1.06–1.80, d = 0.18) and severity (aRRR = 2.17, 95\% CI: 1.33–3.53, (aRRR = 0.43) of suicidal ideation during COVID-19 lockdown. This study further highlights the social disparities that exist in suicidal ideation during COVID-19 lockdown in international samples, for which greater medical and mental health interventions are critical. As such, targeted multicomponent interventions that address substance use are important for reducing the rising prevalence and severity of COVID-related suicidal ideation.},

Four databases (CINAHL, PubMed, Cochrane, and Sociological Abstracts) were searched to identify relevant articles. Thirty-one peer-reviewed articles published from 2010 to 2020 were reviewed. The results highlight that adolescents’ perceived drinking norms derived from their parents and peers, such as approving or disapproving attitudes, significantly influence adolescents’ drinking intention and behaviors. Moreover, pro-drinking messages, advertisements, and postings from electronic media (i.e., TV, movies, and the Internet) and online social networks (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter) shape adolescents’ drinking intention and encourage adolescents to initiate alcohol consumption early and/or escalate their drinking. Thus, future interventions should focus on subjective drinking norms that stem from interpersonal relationships in combination with perceived descriptive drinking norms derived from various media exposure.},

	abstract = {The Strategic Prevention Framework (SPF) is a conceptual model that supports coalition-driven efforts to address underage drinking and related consequences. Although the SPF has been promoted by the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s Center for Substance Abuse Prevention and implemented in multiple U.S. states and territories, there is limited research on the SPF’s effectiveness on improving targeted outcomes and associated influencing factors. The present quasi-experimental study examines the effects of SPF implementation on binge drinking and enforcement of existing underage drinking laws as an influencing factor. The intervention group encompassed 11 school districts that were implementing the SPF with local prevention coalitions across eight Kansas communities. The comparison group consisted of 14 school districts that were matched based on demographic variables. The intervention districts collectively facilitated 137 community-level changes, including new or modified programs, policies, and practices. SPF implementation supported significant improvements in binge drinking and enforcement outcomes over time (p {\textless} .001), although there were no significant differences in improvements between the intervention and matched comparison groups (p {\textgreater} .05). Overall, the findings provide a basis for guiding future research and community-based prevention practice in implementing and evaluating the SPF.},

However, they are difficult to study because they cannot be identified using conventional data on fertility. We use data from a representative sample in the United States to examine the prevalence, age of decision, and interpersonal warmth judgments by and about childfree adults. Our prevalence estimates suggest that childfree adults are quite common, comprising over one-fifth (21.64\%) of the population. Our analysis of age-to-decision suggests that most childfree adults reported that they decided they did not want children early in life. Finally, our analysis of interpersonal warmth suggests asymmetric affective polarization among parents and childfree adults driven primarily by parent’s ingroup favoritism. We discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of childfree adults and for future research on this historically overlooked segment of the population.},

	abstract = {The role of oxytocin in maternal caregiving and other postpartum behaviours has been studied for more than five decades. How oxytocin interacts with other neurochemical systems to enact these behavioural changes, however, is only slowly being elucidated. The best-studied oxytocin–neurotransmitter interaction is with the mesolimbic dopamine system, and this interaction is essential for maternal motivation and active caregiving behaviours such as retrieval of pups. Considerably less attention has been dedicated to investigating how oxytocin interacts with central serotonin to influence postpartum behaviour. Recently, it has become clear that while oxytocin–dopamine interactions regulate the motivational and pup-approach aspects of maternal caregiving behaviours, oxytocin–serotonin interactions appear to regulate nearly all other aspects including postpartum nursing, aggression, anxiety-like behaviour and stress coping strategy. Collectively, oxytocin's interactions with central dopamine and serotonin systems are thus critical for the entire suite of behavioural adaptations exhibited in the postpartum period, and these sites of interaction are potential pharmacological targets for where oxytocin could help to ameliorate deficits in maternal caregiving and poor postpartum mental health.

	abstract = {Many pregnant and postpartum women worldwide suffer from high anxiety and/or depression, which can have detrimental effects on maternal and infant well-being. The first-line pharmacotherapies for prepartum and postpartum affective disorders continue to be the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), despite the lack of large well-controlled studies demonstrating their efficacy in reproducing women and the potential for fetal/neonatal exposure to the drugs. Prepartum or postpartum use of SSRIs or other drugs that modulate the brain’s serotonin system is also troubling because very little is known about the typical, let alone the atypical, changes that occur in the female central serotonin system across reproduction. We do know from a handful of studies of women and female laboratory rodents that numerous aspects of the central serotonin system are naturally dynamic across reproduction and are also affected by pregnancy stress (a major predisposing factor for maternal psychopathology). Thus, it should not be assumed that the maternal central serotonin system being targeted by SSRIs is identical to non-parous females or males. More information about the normative and stress-derailed changes in the maternal central serotonin system is essential for understanding how serotonin is involved in the etiology of, and the best use of SSRIs for potentially treating, affective disorders in the pregnant and postpartum populations.},

	url = {http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2021.01.31.429043},
	abstract = {The ventral pallidum (VP) has been implicated in the regulation of rewarding adult social behaviors, such as pair-bonding and sociosexual motivation. However, the role of the VP in regulating rewarding juvenile social behaviors, such as social play, is unknown. Social play is predominantly displayed by juveniles of many mammalian species and engagement in social play helps develop social competence. In this study, we determined whether the VP is involved in regulating social play in juvenile rats by temporarily inactivating the VP via bilateral infusions of muscimol, the GABAA receptor agonist. Muscimol treatment decreased social play duration in males and females compared to the same-sex control groups. We then focused on the vasopressin (AVP) system in the VP as one potential modulator of social play. We examined the organization of the AVP system in the VP in juvenile rats and found robust sex differences, with denser AVPimmunoreacive fibers and denser vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR) binding in males compared to females, but a greater number of V1aR-expressing cells in females compared to males. Next, we determined whether exposure to social play changed the activation of V1aR-expressing VP cells in male and female juvenile rats. We found that exposure to social play enhanced the number of V1aR-expressing VP cells co-expressing fos, a marker of neuronal activation, in males only. Finally, we determined the causal involvement of AVP signaling in the VP in social play behavior by infusion of a specific V1aR antagonist into the VP prior to social play exposure. We found that V1aR blockade in the VP increased social play duration in juvenile male rats but decreased social play duration in juvenile female rats compared to same-sex control groups. These findings reveal structural and functional sex differences in the AVP system in the VP that are associated with the sex-specific regulation of juvenile social play behavior.},

These constraints are formulated algebraically and tested through simulation of latency and error data from the Tower of Hanoi, a means-ends puzzle that depends heavily on suspension and resumption of goals.

In a large sample (N = 404 contributing data), we examined the predictive and incremental validity of placekeeping, which is the ability to perform a sequence of operations in a certain order without omissions or repetitions. In the context of multitasking, placekeeping should play a role in the performance of procedural subtasks and the interleaving of subtasks that interrupt each other. Regression analyses revealed that placekeeping ability accounted for 11\% of the variance in multitasking performance, and had incremental validity relative to each of a diverse set of cognitive abilities (working memory capacity, fluid intelligence, perceptual speed, and crystallized intelligence). The predictive validity of placekeeping for multitasking was stable across samples of performance and robust to placekeeping practice. Broader measures of performance on our placekeeping task accounted for 21\% of the variance in multitasking performance and had incremental validity relative to an estimate of psychometric g. The results provide evidence that placekeeping is a distinct cognitive ability with its own specific role to play in multitasking, and raise the possibility that measures of placekeeping ability could have utility in selecting personnel for occupations that require certain kinds of multitasking, such as interleaving of procedures.},

Participants (N = 289) performed two tasks (Letterwheel and UNRAVEL) that share a sequential structure but are otherwise distinct. Placekeeping measures correlated significantly across tasks after controlling for construct-irrelevant variance, evidence that individual differences in placekeeping ability correlated across tasks rather than varying independently. Furthermore, an empirical pattern in the form of a crossover interaction in placekeeping error gradients was evident for both tasks, evidence that placekeeping in the two tasks is supported by similar cognitive mechanisms.

However, relatively few studies have directly compared the psychometric properties of global and experiential well-being measures. The present study was a one-month longitudinal design in which we collected up to three measures of (1) global well-being and (2) experiential well-being as measured via the day reconstruction method. These data were used to examine the temporal stability in both types of measures. Moreover, we also examined the criterion-related validity of global and experiential well-being by examining their correlations with theoretically-relevant variables. Results indicated that the majority of variance in all well-being variables was stable across one month—with global life satisfaction being the most stable and experiential negative affect being the least stable. Moreover, in our study, the criterion-related validities for global and experiential well-being were similar. These results seem to affirm the reliability and validity of global measures, and suggest that global and experiential measures of well-being may have similar psychometric properties.},

Sex differences in the VP and OT systems may therefore be implicated in sex-specific regulation of healthy as well as impaired social behaviors. We begin this review by highlighting the sex differences, or lack of sex differences, in VP and OT synthesis in the brain. We then discuss the evidence showing the presence or absence of sex differences in VP and OT receptors in rodents and humans, as well as showing new data of sexually dimorphic V1a receptor binding in the rat brain. Importantly, we find that there is lack of comprehensive analysis of sex differences in these systems in common laboratory species, and we find that, when sex differences are present, they are highly brain region- and species-specific. Interestingly, VP system parameters (VP and V1aR) are typically higher in males, while sex differences in the OT system are not always in the same direction, often showing higher OT expression in females, but higher OT receptor expression in males. Furthermore, VP and OT receptor systems show distinct and largely non-overlapping expression in the rodent brain, which may cause these receptors to have either complementary or opposing functional roles in the sex-specific regulation of social behavior. Though still in need of further research, we close by discussing how manipulations of the VP and OT systems have given important insights into the involvement of these neuropeptide systems in the sex-specific regulation of social behavior in rodents and humans.},

	abstract = {People differ in their reaction to situations, resulting in person × situation interactions. These interactions have been emphasized by many theoretical accounts of personality. Nevertheless, empirical progress on person × situation interactions has been slow. This is in part attributable to an insufficient distinction of person and situation variables and of different types of interaction effects. We propose a framework distinguishing four types of interaction effects which vary in their specificity and two processes during which interaction effects can occur. We conducted two large online studies (N = 622 and N = 818 participants) with standardized situation stimuli (N = 62 pictures and N = 62 first-person perspective videos) and assessed Big Five traits, DIAMONDS situation characteristics, and Big Five states. Using pre-registered multi-level models, we systematically quantified the different types of interaction effects. We found (1) large person × situation interaction variance in personality states, (2) sizable individual differences in situation characteristic–state contingencies, (3) consistent but smaller between-situation differences in trait–state associations, and (4) some significant but small personality trait × situation characteristic interactions. Moreover, we (5) observed some significant but small personality trait × situation characteristic interactions during situation construal and during the reaction to perceived situations. Our findings highlight that person × situation interactions are an important predictor of psychological states, although the person variables involved in these interactions are still relatively unknown. Individual differences in the reaction to situations should thus be incorporated into our understanding of personality structure and processes.},

The result is a map that both simplifies and highlights the regularities in the structure and their relationships. We illustrate the method by making a map of scientific communication as captured in the citation patterns of {\textgreater}6,000 journals. We discover a multicentric organization with fields that vary dramatically in size and degree of integration into the network of science. Along the backbone of the network—including physics, chemistry, molecular biology, and medicine—information flows bidirectionally, but the map reveals a directional pattern of citation from the applied fields to the basic sciences.},

And I write as a race scholar, meaning simply that I believe that race--and racism--affects the sociopolitical conditions in which humans, and scholars, develop their thoughts, feelings, and actions. I believe that it is important for all scholars to have a basic understanding of these conditions, as well as the landmines and pitfalls that define them, as they shape how research is conducted, reviewed, and disseminated. I also believe that to evolve one’s discipline into one that is truly robust and objective, it must first become diverse and self-aware.

	abstract = {Objective: The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) is a widely used self-report measure of subjective emotion ability, as defined by a prominent clinically derived model of emotion regulation (). Although the DERS is often used in treatment and research settings for adults with emotional (i.e., anxiety, mood, obsessive-compulsive, or trauma-related) disorders, its psychometric properties are not well-characterized in this population., Method: We examined the psychometric properties of the DERS and three popular short forms (DERS-16; DERS-18; and DERS-SF) in a large (N = 427) sample of treatment-seeking adults with one or more DSM-5 emotional disorders., Results: For the original DERS, internal consistency was strong for all subscales except Awareness. A bifactor structure consisting of one general emotion dysregulation factor and five uncorrelated specific factors corresponding to the original DERS subscales (excluding Awareness) provided the best fit. A series of structural equation models (SEMs) demonstrated unique incremental contributions of the general factor and several specific factors to explaining concurrent clinical severity. The general factor and one specific factor (Goals) also prospectively predicted treatment outcome following a naturalistic course of outpatient cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in a subset of participants (n = 202) for whom discharge data were available. Specifically, more severe emotion dysregulation at intake predicted better CBT response, while more severe impairment in goal-directed activity when distressed predicted worse CBT response. All three short forms showed a robust bifactor structure and good internal consistency and convergent validity vis-à-vis the original measure, albeit with a slight decrement in incremental utility (1–3\% less variance explained in clinical severity)., Conclusion: With the Awareness items excluded, the DERS showed good internal consistency and a robust bifactor latent structure. The general factor and several specific factors incrementally and prospectively predicted clinical severity and treatment outcome, which suggests that the DERS may have clinical and predictive utility in treatment-seeking adults with emotional disorders. Additional research is needed to establish convergent and discriminant validity in this population. The use of a short form in lieu of the full DERS may be sufficient for many general clinical and research purposes, particularly when participant burden is a concern.},

Further, few studies look at the structure of personality traits a-theoretically, often neglecting to examine the relationship among indicators within a trait (convergence) and across traits (divergence). Using a network approach, the present study examines (1) age differences in divergence and convergence, (2) the similarity between the Big Five and network structures, and (3) the consistency of network structure across age groups in a large, cross-sectional sample. Results indicate that convergence shows early gains in adolescence with few differences across the lifespan, while divergence mostly weakens across adulthood. The result of these age-related differences is that Big Five indicators only parallel the Big Five structure among young but not older adults. The structure of young adults tends to be quite similar while the network structures of older adults appear to greatly differ from one another. These results suggest that older adults have a different structure of personality than younger adults and suggest that future research should not assume consistency in personality structure across the lifespan.},

It is usually treated as an interval scale, but strictly speaking it is an ordinal scale, where arithmetic operations cannot be conducted. There are pros and cons in using the Likert scale as an interval scale, but the controversy can be handled by increasing the number of points. Several researchers have suggested bringing the number up to eleven, on the basis of empirical data. In this article the authors explore this rational and share the same view, but simulate artificial data from both symmetrical normal and skewed distributions where the underlying metric is known in advance. Results show that more Likert scale points will result in a closer approach to the underlying distribution, and hence normality and interval scales. To increase generalizability social work practitioners are encouraged to use 11-point Likert scales from 0 to 10, a natural and easily comprehensible range.},

In Study 1 (N = 2,492), respondents completed 20 questions (comprising four short scales) presented in a matrix grid (converted to item-by-item format on mobile phones). We varied the number of rows (5, 10, or 20) and columns (3, 5, or 7) of the matrix on each page. Outcomes included both data quality (straightlining, item skip rate, and internal reliability of scales) and survey experience measures (dropout rate, rating of survey experience, and completion time). Results for row size revealed dropout rate and reported survey difficulty increased as row size increased. For column size, seven columns increased the completion time of the survey, while three columns produced lower scale reliability. There was no interaction between row and column size. The best overall size tested was a 5 ? 5 matrix. In Study 2 (N = 2,570), we tested whether the effects of row size replicated when using a single 20-item scale that crossed page breaks and found that participant survey ratings were still best in the five-row condition. These results suggest that having around five rows or potentially fewer per page, and around five columns for answer options, gives the optimal survey experience, with equal or better data quality, when using matrix-style questions in an online survey. These recommendations will help researchers gain the benefits of using matrices in their surveys with the least downsides of the format.},

	abstract = {Multilevel autoregressive models are popular choices for the analysis of intensive longitudinal data in psychology. Empirical studies have found a positive correlation between autoregressive parameters of affective time series and the between-person measures of psychopathology, a phenomenon known as the staging effect. However, it has been argued that such findings may represent a statistical artifact: Although common models assume normal error distributions, empirical data (for instance, measurements of negative affect among healthy individuals) often exhibit the floor effect, that is response distributions with high skewness, low mean, and low variability. In this paper, we investigated whether—and to what extent—the floor effect leads to erroneous conclusions by means of a simulation study. We describe three dynamic models which have meaningful substantive interpretations and can produce floor-effect data. We simulate multilevel data from these models, varying skewness but keeping the autoregressive parameter fixed across individuals, while also varying the number of time points and cases. Analyzing these data with the standard multilevel AR(1) model we found that positive bias only occurs when modeling with random residual variance, whereas modeling with fixed residual variance leads to negative bias. We discuss the implications of our study for data collection and modeling choices.},

	abstract = {Rationale
Examining interactions between numerous interlocking social identities and the systems of oppression and privilege that shape them is central to health inequalities research. Multilevel models are an alternative and novel approach to examining health inequalities at the intersection of multiple social identities. This approach draws attention to the heterogeneity within and between intersectional social strata by partitioning the total variance across two levels.
Method
Utilizing a familiar empirical example from social epidemiology—body mass index among U.S. adults (N = 32,788)—we compare the application of multilevel models to the conventional fixed effects approach to studying high-dimension interactions. Researchers are often confronted with the need to explore numerous interactions of identities and social processes. We explore the interactions of five dimensions of social identity and position—gender, race/ethnicity, income, education, and age—for a total of 384 unique intersectional social strata.
Results
We find that the multilevel approach provides advantages over conventional models, including scalability for higher dimensions, adjustment for sample size of social strata, model parsimony, and ease of interpretation.
Conclusion
Considerable variation is attributable to the within-strata level, indicating the low discriminatory accuracy of these intersectional identities and the high within-strata heterogeneity of risk that remains unexplained. Multilevel modeling is an innovative and valuable tool for evaluating the intersectionality of health inequalities.},

In the following, we provide recommendations for programs of research aimed at identifying sources of heterogeneity in women’s experiences with HC. First, we review research demonstrating person- and prescription- based heterogeneity in women’s psychobehavioral responses to HCs. Next, we identify several promising person- and prescription- based sources of this heterogeneity that warrant future research. We close with a discussion of research approaches that are particularly well-suited to address the research questions raised in article. Together, this review provides researchers with several promising research pathways to help support the development of a precision medicine approach to HC treatment.},

	abstract = {In this article we adopt the view that emotion dysregulation is characterized by emotion regulation dynamics that are defined as dysfunctional based on contextual criteria. We regard the construct of emotion regulation as valuable because it permits the integration of the classic view of emotions as interfering with human functioning and contemporary views of emotion as adaptive and beneficial. To define patterns that reflect emotion dysregulation, we explain our views of emotion as a dynamic process, and emotion regulation as the bidirectional interplay between emotions and actions/thoughts (extrinsic factors) and the contextual factors that constitute the criteria for that interplay reflecting dysregulation. This conceptualization of emotion regulation and dysregulation leads to methods for studying the intrinsic dynamics of emotion, extrinsic factors that change the intrinsic dynamics of emotion, and how emotion regulation changes over time at multiple time scales. We then apply this thinking to several emotion dysregulation patterns. Emotion regulation is a complex construct, embracing emotion as regulator and as regulated, as self- and other-regulated, and as incorporating both top-down and bottom-up regulatory processes. We highlight an emerging line of research on the development of emotion regulation in early childhood and indicate how this work can inform understanding of emotion dysregulation and the emergence of psychopathology.},

In this article, we review a lineage of conceptual models and suggest a path toward a more unifying model of self-regulation that encompasses both the dynamics of moment-to-moment changes and age-related change. Drawing from these models, we define self-regulation as the influence of the recruitment of executive processes (EP) on prepotent responses (PR). We define these terms, locating self-regulation in the dynamic relations between PR and EP, and offer a theoretical–mathematical approach to testing this model.},

We propose three foundational elements: the learner, instructional principles, and training delivery (methods and media). Understanding and applying instructional principles are the primary methods for enhancing training effectiveness; thus, we detail 15 empirically supported principles. We then discuss the erroneous pursuit of aptitude-by-treatment interactions under the guise of learner styles and age-specific instruction. Finally, we offer suggestions for future research that draw on the foundation of instructional principles to optimize self-directed learning and learning in synthetic learning environments.

We concur with the committee that the inclusion of psychosocial variables in electronic health records will broadly benefit researchers, practitioners, and patients and that there is clear need for a recommended panel of psychosocial measures that is ready for implementation in clinical settings. In fact, it seems likely that these recommendations will have lasting consequences. Given this, our response highlights several concerns about the recommendations and criteria.

After the onset of a major chronic disease, high levels of neuroticism predicted less smoking when paired with high levels of conscientiousness, a combination described as healthy neuroticism. Healthy neuroticism only predicted smoking behavior after the onset of disease, not before, suggesting that the relationship between personality and responses to health problems differs from the relationship between personality and the onset of health problems.},

Moreover, changes in positive support across relationship partners coincided with trait changes over time, in the form of more positive support was associated with seemingly adaptive changes on the Big Five. Findings are discussed with respect to identifying social influences on personality development in adulthood.},

	abstract = {Objective: The present research examined the effects of the social environment on the onset of specific health ailments. Design: Using data from the Health and Retirement Study, we examined participants’ responses to social environment questions in 2006 as predictors of onset of different health conditions over the next four years.Main Outcome Measures: Healthy participants (n = 7514) reported on their number of social partners, interaction frequency, positive social support and negative social support with respect to both their family and friends. These variables were used to predict onset of seven conditions in 2010: high blood pressure, heart condition, lung disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes and arthritis.Results: Logistic regressions indicated that the social environment provided some predictive value for onset of most health outcomes, with more positive and less negative social support appearing to buffer against onset. Social environmental variables related to friendships appeared to play a greater role than the family indicators. However, no variable proved universally adaptive, and social indicators had little value in predicting onset of chronic conditions.Conclusion: The current findings point to the potential for the social environment to influence later health, while demonstrating the nuanced role that our social lives play with respect to health.},

	abstract = {The classic Aesop’s fable, Crow and the Pitcher, has inspired a major line of research in comparative cognition. Over the past several years, five articles (over 32 experiments) have examined the ability of corvids (e.g., rooks, crows, and jays) to complete lab-based analogs of this fable, by requiring them to drop stones and other objects into tubes of water to retrieve a floating worm (Bird and Emery in Curr Biol 19:1–5, ; Cheke et al. in Anim Cogn 14:441–455, ; Jelbert et al. in PLoS One 3:e92895, ; Logan et al. in PLoS One 7:e103049, ; Taylor et al. in Gray R D 12:e26887, ). These researchers have stressed the unique potential of this paradigm for understanding causal reasoning in corvids. Ghirlanda and Lind (Anim Behav 123:239–247, ) re-evaluated trial-level data from these studies and concluded that initial preferences for functional objects, combined with trial-and-error learning, may account for subjects’ performance on key variants of the paradigm. In the present paper, we use meta-analytic techniques to provide more precise information about the rate and mode of learning that occurs within and across tasks. Within tasks, subjects learned from successful (but not unsuccessful) actions, indicating that higher-order reasoning about phenomena such as mass, volume, and displacement is unlikely to be involved. Lurthermore, subjects did not transfer information learned in one task to subsequent tasks, suggesting that corvids do not engage with these tasks as variants of the same problem (i.e., how to generate water displacement to retrieve a floating worm). Our methodological analysis and empirical findings raise the question: Can Aesop’s fable studies distinguish between trial-and-error learning and/or higher-order causal reasoning? We conclude they cannot.},

	abstract = {People are typically less physically active when experiencing stress, an unavoidable aspect of life. Since physical activity has been associated with health benefits, it is important to understand what influences physical activity during stress. Research has demonstrated that individuals who are high in conscientiousness are more physically active; however, studies that have examined physical activity among people high in neuroticism have yielded mixed findings. Healthy neuroticism, a term used to describe individuals high in conscientiousness and neuroticism, may explain these mixed results. While individuals low in conscientiousness and high in neuroticism may become overwhelmed, stress may motivate people high in healthy neuroticism to be physically active as an investment in their future. We assessed older adults’ (N = 60; Mage = 70.72; 76.70\% cisgender women) personality at baseline as well as daily physical activity and daily stress over 14 days. Regression analyses investigated whether daily stress predicted daily physical activity and whether healthy neuroticism moderated the physical activity-stress association. Ultimately, this study found that daily stress did not predict daily physical activity; as stress increased, individuals higher in conscientiousness were less physically active, while individuals lower in conscientiousness were more active. These findings were inconsistent with our predictions and previous research. Consequently, we propose future research directions and potential explanations for these unforeseen findings.},

We argue that complex and seemingly arbitrary benchmarks for assessing MI can be unrealistic and effectively prohibit meaningful research. The widespread use of various MI criteria creates unnecessary and often unattainable hurdles for cross-cultural researchers who have made the effort to collect data in multiple cultural contexts. Additionally, the prohibitionist tone of discussions surrounding MI is unhelpful and unscientific. We argue that emerging findings that cultural differences might not be as widespread or profound as once assumed imply that significant cross-cultural differences in measurement should not be the default assumption. Additionally, we advocate a shift towards external validity as a more useful metric of measurement quality. Our overall message is that researchers who go to the considerable trouble of gathering data in more than one country should not be disadvantaged compared to researchers who avoid cross-cultural complications by gathering data only at their home campus.},

Due to their structural similarity to written language, transformer-based architectures have also shown promise as tools to make sense of a range of multi-variate sequences from protein-structures, music, electronic health records to weather-forecasts. We can also represent human lives in a way that shares this structural similarity to language. From one perspective, lives are simply sequences of events: People are born, visit the pediatrician, start school, move to a new location, get married, and so on. Here, we exploit this similarity to adapt innovations from natural language processing to examine the evolution and predictability of human lives based on detailed event sequences. We do this by drawing on arguably the most comprehensive registry data in existence, available for an entire nation of more than six million individuals across decades. Our data include information about life-events related to health, education, occupation, income, address, and working hours, recorded with day-to-day resolution. We create embeddings of life-events in a single vector space showing that this embedding space is robust and highly structured. Our models allow us to predict diverse outcomes ranging from early mortality to personality nuances, outperforming state-of-the-art models by a wide margin. Using methods for interpreting deep learning models, we probe the algorithm to understand the factors that enable our predictions. Our framework allows researchers to identify new potential mechanisms that impact life outcomes and associated possibilities for personalized interventions.},

We contribute to mapping the semantics of risk based on word associations to provide insight into both universal and individual differences in the representation of risk. Specifically, we introduce a mini-snowball word association paradigm and use the tools of network and sentiment analysis to characterize the semantics of risk. We find that association-based representations not only corroborate but also extend those extracted from past survey- and text-based approaches. Crucially, we find that the semantics of risk show universal properties and individual and group differences. Most notably, while semantic clusters generalize across languages, their frequency varies systematically across demographic groups, with older and female respondents showing more negative connotations and mentioning more often certain types of activities (e.g., recreational activities) relative to younger adults and males, respectively. Our work has general implications for the measurement of risk-related constructs by suggesting that “risk” can mean different things to different individuals.

We have performed an analysis of how personalized perception of texts is affected by individual human profile and bias. To acquire comprehensive knowledge about individual user prefer- ences, we have gathered 40 users who annotated 1000 texts in 26 subjective tasks grouped into three categories: positive affect, neg- ative affect, and rational affect. The results revealed that categories of annotation were correlated with psychological dimensions, e.g., agreeableness and conscientiousness, which are traits related to pos- itive affect dimension biases. We have observed the presence of two clearly defined categories among annotators when it comes to the aspect of humor: those who confidently share their perspectives on what they find funny and those who tend to rate humor levels within a narrow range. Moreover, we analyzed intra-annotator agreement to show that people tend to change their ratings over time. Our results show that the higher level of the ranking correlation between anno- tations and agreement calculated using binarized annotations com- pared to the absolute agreement calculated using full annotations im- plies that the 10-point annotation scale might be a significant factor in annotator disagreement.},

	abstract = {Aging and lifespan development researchers have been fortunate to have public access to many longitudinal datasets. These data are valuable and see high utilization, yet this has a considerable downside. Many of these are heavily overused. Overuse of publicly available datasets creates dependency among published research papers giving the false impression of independent contributions to knowledge by reporting the same associations over multiple papers. This is a potentially serious problem in the aging literature given the high use of a relatively small number of well-known studies. Any irregularities or sampling biases in this relatively small number of samples have outsize influence on perceived answers to key aging questions. We detail this problem, focusing on issues of dependency among studies, sampling bias and overfitting, and contradictory estimates of the same effect from the same data in independent publications. We provide solutions, including greater use of data sharing, pre-registrations, holdout samples, split-sample cross-validation, and coordinated analysis. We argue these valuable datasets are public resources that are being diminished by overuse, with parallels in environmental science. Taking a conservation perspective, we hold that these practices (pre-registration, holdout samples) can preserve data resources for future generations of researchers.

These factors, combined with elevated fertility in many countries during the 2 decades after World War II (i.e., the "Baby Boom"), will result in increased numbers of persons aged {\textgreater} or = 65 years during 2010-2030. Worldwide, the average life span is expected to extend another 10 years by 2050. The growing number of older adults increases demands on the public health system and on medical and social services. Chronic diseases, which affect older adults disproportionately, contribute to disability, diminish quality of life, and increased health- and long-term-care costs. Increased life expectancy reflects, in part, the success of public health interventions, but public health programs must now respond to the challenges created by this achievement, including the growing burden of chronic illnesses, injuries, and disabilities and increasing concerns about future caregiving and healthcare costs.

Most previous studies have examined only a single specific health care service or disease condition or have focused exclusively on economic variables. We aim to measure age-related change in health care utilization among the elderly. Methods A population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted using linked data from four administrative databases (OHIP, ODB, CIHI and RPDB). All Ontario residents over the age of 65 years and eligible for public health coverage were included in the analysis (approximately 1.6 million residents). Main outcome measures include utilization indicators for family physician visits, specialist physician visits, Emergency Department visits, drugs, lab claims, X-rays, inpatient admissions, CT scans and MRI scans. Results The mean number of utilization events for Ontarians aged 65+ years for the 1-year study period was 70 events (women = 76, men = 63). The overall absolute difference between the 65–69 age group and the 85+ age group was 155\% (women = 162\%, men = 130\%), or 76 more events per person in the older group (women = 82, men = 61). Women averaged more events per person than men, as well as greater percentage differences by age. Drugs and diagnostics account for the majority of events. Only MRI and specialist visits were not higher among the older age groups. Conclusions At the population level, overall health care utilization would appear to increase significantly with age. It is unclear whether increasing health care utilization prevents morbidity, decreases mortality, or improves quality of life.},

In reality there is no rule of thumb that applies to all situations. The sample size needed for a study depends on many factors, including the size of the model, distribution of the variables, amount of missing data, reliability of the variables, and strength of the relations among the variables. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate how substantive researchers can use a Monte Carlo study to decide on sample size and determine power. Two models are used as examples, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model and a growth model. The analyses are carried out using the Mplus program (Muthén\& Muthén 1998).},

The present study used data from 200 patients (effective Ns range from 84 to 191), who were being discharged from the emergency department at an urban hospital, to investigate whether the Big Five personality traits were associated with post-discharge outcomes (i.e., filling prescriptions, following up with primary care physician, making an unscheduled return to the emergency department). Using logistic regression, we found few associations among the broad Big Five domains and post-discharge outcomes. However, results showed statistically significant associations between specific Big Five items (e.g., “responsible”) and the three post-discharge outcomes. This study demonstrates the feasibility of assessing personality traits in an emergency medicine setting and highlights the utility of having information about patients’ personality tendencies for predicting post-discharge compliance.},

	abstract = {Objectives: This study aimed to assess and explore factors affecting diabetes self-management (DSM) among Omani adults with type one diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from May to November 2018. Convenience sampling was used to recruit participants from three referral hospitals in Oman. Data were collected using the Diabetes Self-Management Questionnaire, Empowerment Scale (short form), Medical Outcome Study Social Support Scale, Diabetes Knowledge Test and glycosylated haemoglobin test results. Linear multiple regression analysis was used to explore possible predictors of DSM. Results: A total of 210 people participated in the study (response rate: 87.5\%). The majority of participants were female (70.5\%) with a mean age of 26.82 ± 8.25 years. The mean score for DSM was 6.8 ± 1.4, which represents 68\% of the total maximum score. More than one-third (36.2\%) of the participants had poor glycaemic control. The predictors of high levels of DSM were being employed (P = 0.049), earning a low monthly income of less than 300 Omani rials (P = 0.014), having other chronic diseases (P = 0.029), a high diabetes self-efficacy (DSE; P = 0.003) and high social support (SS; P = 0.006). Conclusion: According to the findings of this study, Omanis with T1DM have suboptimal DSM levels. Factors such as diabetes knowledge, DSE and SS are modifiable factors that can be targeted by interventions from different healthcare professionals to enhance DSM.

Typically, these hypotheses have been investigated by using difference scores or other profile similarity indices as predictors of the outcome variables. These approaches, however, have been vigorously criticized for their conceptual and statistical shortcomings. Here, we introduce a statistical method that is based on polynomial regression and addresses most of these shortcomings: dyadic response surface analysis. This model is tailored for similarity effect hypotheses and fully accounts for the dyadic nature of relationship data. Furthermore, we provide a tutorial with an illustrative example and reproducible R and Mplus scripts that should assist substantive researchers in precisely formulating, testing, and interpreting their dyadic similarity effect hypotheses. © 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology},

(c) Girls showed a more mature personality overall (self-reports and parent ratings revealed higher levels of Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness) and became more extraverted in the middle of adolescence (self-reports).

	abstract = {Personality traits are powerful predictors of outcomes in the domains of education, work, relationships, health, and well-being. The recognized importance of personality traits has raised questions about their policy relevance –that is, their potential to inform policy actions designed to improve human welfare. Traditionally, the use of personality traits in applied settings has been predicated on their ability to predict valued outcomes, typically under the assumption that traits are functionally unchanging. This assumption, however, is both untrue and a limiting factor on using personality traits more widely in applied settings.In this paper, we present the case that traits can serve both as relatively stable predictors of success and actionable targets for policy changes and interventions. Though trait change will likely prove a more difficult target than typical targets in applied interventions, it also may be a more fruitful one given the variety of life domains affected by personality traits. Public significance statement: This paper presents the case that personality traits can serve both as predictors of success and actionable targets for policy changes and interventions. The field of personality psychology has now amassed evidence necessary to address the policy relevance of personality traits. To that end, we pose and answer critical questions regarding personality traits and their applicability for policy initiatives in applied settings.},

Most of past research on the associations between parenting and child Big Five traits specifically has used cross-sectional data. The few longitudinal studies that examined these associations found small relations between parenting and child personality. We extended this research by examining the long-term relations between four underexplored parenting dimensions and child Big Five personality traits using bivariate latent growth models in a large longitudinal dataset (N = 3,880). Results from growth models revealed a preponderance of null relations between these parenting measures and child personality, especially between changes in parenting and changes in child personality. In general, the observed associations between parenting and child Big Five personality were comparable in magnitude to the association between factors such as SES and birth order, and child personality—that is, small. The small associations between environmental factors and personality suggest that personality development in childhood and adolescence may be driven by multiple factors, each of which makes a small contribution.},

extended GMM is first presented in which class probabilities depend on some
observed explanatory variables and data missingness depends on both the
explanatory variables and a latent class variable. A full Bayesian method is
then proposed to estimate the model. Through the data augmentation method,
conditional posterior distributions for all model parameters and missing data
are obtained. A Gibbs sampling procedure is then used to generate Markov chains
of model parameters for statistical inference. The application of the model and
the method is first demonstrated through the analysis of mathematical ability
growth data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (). A simulation study considering 3 main factors (the
sample size, the class probability, and the missing data mechanism) is then
conducted and the results show that the proposed Bayesian estimation approach
performs very well under the studied conditions. Finally, some implications of
this study, including the misspecified missingness mechanism, the sample size,
the sensitivity of the model, the number of latent classes, the model
comparison, and the future directions of the approach, are discussed.},

	abstract = {Growth mixture modeling is a popular analytic tool for longitudinal data analysis. It detects latent groups based on the shapes of growth trajectories. Traditional growth mixture modeling assumes that outcome variables are normally distributed within each class. When data violate this normality assumption, however, it is well documented that the traditional growth mixture modeling mislead researchers in determining the number of latent classes as well as in estimating parameters. To address nonnormal data in growth mixture modeling, robust methods based on various nonnormal distributions have been developed. As a new robust approach, growth mixture modeling based on conditional medians has been proposed. In this article, we present the results of two simulation studies that evaluate the performance of the median-based growth mixture modeling in identifying the correct number of latent classes when data follow the normality assumption or have outliers. We also compared the performance of the median-based growth mixture modeling to the performance of traditional growth mixture modeling as well as robust growth mixture modeling based on t distributions. For identifying the number of latent classes in growth mixture modeling, the following three Bayesian model comparison criteria were considered: deviance information criterion, Watanabe-Akaike information criterion, and leave-one-out cross validation. For the median-based growth mixture modeling and t-based growth mixture modeling, our results showed that they maintained quite high model selection accuracy across all conditions in this study (ranged from 87 to 100\%). In the traditional growth mixture modeling, however, the model selection accuracy was greatly influenced by the proportion of outliers. When sample size was 500 and the proportion of outliers was 0.05, the correct model was preferred in about 90\% of the replications, but the percentage dropped to about 40\% as the proportion of outliers increased to 0.15.},

	abstract = {AIM
To design and evaluate psychometrics of adolescent self-report and parent proxy-report questionnaires assessing readiness for independent self-care in adolescents with type 1 diabetes (RISQ-T and RISQ-P).

METHODS
178 adolescents with type 1 diabetes (ages 13–17 years) and their parents completed the 20-item RISQ-T and 15-item RISQ-P, along with diabetes-specific measures of parent involvement, self-efficacy, burden, and treatment adherence. Evaluation of psychometric properties included calculation of internal consistency, adolescent and parent agreement, test-retest reliability, concurrent and predictive validity.

RESULTS
The RISQ-T (α=.78) and RISQ-P (α=.77) demonstrated sound internal consistency. Higher RISQ-T and RISQ-P scores (indicating more adolescent readiness for independent self-care) showed significant associations with less parent involvement in diabetes care (adolescent r=−.34; parent r=−.47; p{\textless}.0001), greater adolescent diabetes self-efficacy (adolescent r=.32; parent r=.54; p{\textless}.0001), less parent-endorsed diabetes-related burden (parent r=−.30; p{\textless}.0001), and greater treatment adherence (adolescent r=.26, p=.0004; parent r=.31, p{\textless}.0001). Adolescent and parent scores were significantly correlated (r=.35; p{\textless}.0001); test-retest reliability was reasonable (ICC RISQ-T r=.66; RISQ-P r=.71). Higher baseline RISQ-P scores significantly predicted reduced family involvement after six months (β=−.14, p=.02).

CONCLUSIONS
RISQ-T and RISQ-P demonstrate sound psychometric properties. Surveys may help inform diabetes teams of the level of support needed to facilitate shift to independent self-management.},

	abstract = {Most decisions must be made without advance knowledge of their consequences. Economists and psychologists have devoted much attention to modeling decisions made under conditions of risk in which options can be characterized by a known probability distribution over possible outcomes. The descriptive shortcomings of classical economic models motivated the development of prospect theory (D. Kahneman, A. Tversky, Prospect theory: An analysis of decision under risk. Econometrica, 4 (1979) 263–291; A. Tversky, D. Kahneman, Advances in prospect theory: Cumulative representation of uncertainty. Journal of Risk and Uncertainty, 5 (4) (1992) 297–323) the most successful behavioral model of decision under risk. In the prospect theory, subjective value is modeled by a value function that is concave for gains, convex for losses, and steeper for losses than for gains; the impact of probabilities are characterized by a weighting function that overweights low probabilities and underweights moderate to high probabilities. We outline the possible neural bases of the components of prospect theory, surveying evidence from human imaging, lesion, and neuropharmacology studies as well as animal neurophysiology studies. These results provide preliminary suggestions concerning the neural bases of prospect theory that include a broad set of brain regions and neuromodulatory systems. These data suggest that focused studies of decision making in the context of quantitative models may provide substantial leverage towards a fuller understanding of the cognitive neuroscience of decision making.},

	abstract = {Background:
The majority of youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D) fail to meet glycemic
targets despite increasing continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) use. We
therefore aimed to determine the proportion of caregivers who review recent
glycemic trends (“retrospective review”) and make ensuant insulin
adjustments based on this data (“retroactive insulin adjustments”). We
additionally considered that fear of hypoglycemia and frequency of severe
hypoglycemia would be associated with performing retrospective review.

Methods:
We conducted a cross-sectional survey of caregivers of youth with T1D,
collecting demographics, diabetes technology usage, patterns of glucose data
review/insulin dose self-adjustment, and Hypoglycemia Fear Survey (HFS).

Results:
Nineteen percent of eligible caregivers (191/1003) responded. Performing
retrospective review was associated with younger child age (12.2 versus
15.4, P = .0001) and CGM use (92\% versus 73\%,
P = .004), but was not associated with a significant
improvement in child’s HbA1c (7.89 versus 8.04, P = .65).
Retrospective reviewers had significantly higher HFS-behavior scores (31.9
versus 27.7, P = .0002), which remained significantly
higher when adjusted for child’s age and CGM use (P =
.005). Linear regression identified a significant negative association
between HbA1c (\%) and number of retroactive insulin adjustments (0.24
percent lower mean HbA1c per additional adjustment made, P
= .02).

Conclusions:
Retrospective glucose data review is associated with improved HbA1c when
coupled with data-driven retroactive insulin adjustments. Barriers to data
downloading existed even in this cohort of predominantly CGM-using T1D
families.},

Adolescents with high-anxious mothers reported stronger beliefs that their mothers had high control over their diabetes and their parents were over-protective. For younger adolescents, maternal trait anxiety was associated with higher HbA1c levels and greater absenteeism.

	abstract = {The incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in very young children (YC-T1D) is increasing globally. Managing YC-T1D is challenging from both a medical and psychosocial perspective during this vulnerable developmental period when complete dependence upon parental caretaking is normative and child behavior is unpredictable. The consequences of suboptimal glycemic control during this age range are substantial since these children will have T1D for many years and they are prone to adverse neuropsychological sequelae. Poor adaptation to T1D during these early years may engender a persistent trajectory of negative outcomes that can be very resistant to change. The empirical research on the YC-T1D population (age {\textless}6yr) has indicated multiple mechanisms through which parent characteristics, parent coping skills, and child characteristics interact to yield a pattern of T1D management behaviors that affect T1D outcomes. However, this research has not yet led to a well-conceived conceptual model for identifying and understanding these mechanisms or for specifying research gaps and future research directions. The aim of this review is to propose such a conceptual model linking parent characteristics, parent coping, and child characteristics to T1D management behaviors and outcomes. This article reviews the literature focusing on research pertinent to YC-T1D and elements of our proposed model, identifies and discusses gaps in the literature, offers directions for future research, and considers a range of possible interventions targeting the unique needs of this special population.},

	abstract = {Objectives: This study tested the hypothesis that both trait anxiety and hypoglycemic history contribute to fear of hypoglycemia (FOH) both in adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and in their parents, and relationships between FOH and other variables including metabolic control, symptom perception, and use of insulin pump therapy. Study Design: Thirty-nine parent–adolescent pairs completed questionnaires assessing background and clinical information, hypoglycemic episodes, FOH, and trait anxiety. Adolescent blood was also sampled for glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) measurement.
Results: In adolescents, both trait anxiety and frequency of severe hypoglycemic episodes were significant predictors of FOH, together accounting for almost 50\% of the variance. Parental FOH was not predicted by their own trait anxiety or their child’s hypoglycemic history but by whether they believed that their child carried emergency glucose. FOH was not related to metabolic control, although adolescents who experienced recent severe hypoglycemia (SH) with unconsciousness had significantly higher HbA1c. Parental trait anxiety significantly correlated with child trait anxiety, but parent–child levels of FOH were unrelated. Neither trait anxiety nor FOH related to reported symptoms, and FOH was not lower in parents with insulin pump therapy.
Conclusions: Consistent with findings from adult patient populations, trait anxiety levels and recent experiences with hypoglycemia predict FOH in adolescents with T1DM. In parents, however, beliefs about their adolescents’ ability to cope with hypoglycemic episodes predicted FOH. FOH in adolescents with T1DM and their parents is a complex construct influenced by multiple personality and situational and behavioral factors, and its impact on diabetes management remains unclear.},

Med. 27, 1151–1158 (2010) Abstract Aims The aim of this study was to examine the fear of hypoglycaemia and its association with demographic and disease-specific variables in a large and unselective population of adult patients with Type 1 diabetes. Methods Questionnaires were sent by post to all patients with Type 1 diabetes who were identified in the local diabetes registries of two hospitals in Stockholm, Sweden (n = 1387). Fear of hypoglycaemia was measured using the Swedish Hypoglycaemia Fear Survey, the Worry subscale and the Aloneness subscale. Demographic variables and disease-specific factors were collected from patients’ self reports and medical records. Univariate analysis and multiple stepwise linear regression analysis were used in the statistical analyses of the data. Results Seven hundred and sixty-four (55\%) patients participated in the study (mean age 43.3 years and mean HbA1c 7.0\%, normal {\textless} 5.0\%). The Hypoglycaemia Fear Survey - Worry subscale was significantly associated with frequency of severe hypoglycaemia, number of symptoms during mild hypoglycaemia, gender, hypoglycaemic symptoms during hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemic unawareness. The Hypoglycaemia Fear Survey - Aloneness subscale was significantly associated with frequency of severe hypoglycaemia, number of symptoms during mild hypoglycaemia, gender, frequency of mild hypoglycaemia, HbA1c, hypoglycaemic unawareness and visits to the emergency room because of severe hypoglycaemia. Fear of hypoglycaemia proved to be more prevalent in females and indicated a different pattern between genders in relation to factors associated with fear of hypoglycaemia. Conclusions This study identifies the frequency of severe hypoglycaemia as the most important factor associated with fear of hypoglycaemia. Moreover, for the first time, we document gender differences in fear of hypoglycaemia, suggesting that females are more affected by fear of hypoglycaemia than men.},

	abstract = {Background Regular physical activity has recognised health benefits for people with T1DM. However a significant proportion of them do not undertake the recommended levels of activity. Whilst questionnaire-based studies have examined barriers to exercise in people with T1DM, a formal qualitative analysis of these barriers has not been undertaken. Our aims were to explore attitudes, barriers and facilitators to exercise in patients with T1DM. Methodology A purposeful sample of long standing T1DM patients were invited to participate in this qualitative study. Twenty-six adults were interviewed using a semi-structured interview schedule to determine their level of exercise and barriers to initiation and maintenance of an exercise programme. Principal findings Six main barriers to exercise were identified: lack of time and work related factors; access to facilities; lack of motivation; embarrassment and body image; weather; and diabetes specific barriers (low levels of knowledge about managing diabetes and its complications around exercise). Four motivators to exercise were identified: physical benefits from exercise; improvements in body image; enjoyment and the social interaction of exercising at gym or in groups. Three facilitators to exercise were identified: free or reduced admission to gyms and pools, help with time management, and advice and encouragement around managing diabetes for exercise. Significance Many of the barriers to exercise in people with T1DM are shared with the non-diabetic population. The primary difference is the requirement for education about the effect of exercise on diabetes control and its complications. There was a preference for support to be given on a one to one basis rather than in a group environment. This suggests that with the addition of the above educational requirements, one to one techniques that have been successful in increasing activity in patients with other chronic disease and the general public should be successful in increasing activity in patients with T1DM.},

	abstract = {Background Previous studies have demonstrated that health behaviours may be one of the major mechanisms underlying the relationship between personality and health outcomes. Such health behaviours may be established by consciousness toward one's health that include health literacy. Thus, this study aimed to explore the relationship between health literacy and its correlates, including personality, among community-dwelling older adults. Methods This was a cross-sectional study with 683 older individuals (aged 60–84 years; 326 men and 357 women). A questionnaire was used to assess health literacy, personality, socioeconomic status, health status, and lifestyles. Health literacy was measured using the Communicative and Critical Health Literacy Scale, which is a self-report questionnaire comprising five items assessing degrees of health literacy. The Big Five personality traits were measured using the Japanese version of the Ten-Item Personality Inventory. Other variables were measured as factors associated with health literacy, including age, gender, education, subjective economic status, social isolation, chronic diseases, functional capacity, smoking and drinking. Results Multiple regression analysis showed that education (β = 0.10), subjective economic status (β = −0.09), social isolation (β = −0.08), functional dependence (β = −0.22), neuroticism, (β = −0.08), extraversion (β = 0.10), openness (β = 0.17), and conscientiousness (β = 0.09) were independently and significantly associated with health literacy (coefficient of determination = 0.28). Conclusions This study found significant and independent associations of personality, socioeconomic status, and health status with health literacy. These results may help facilitate the development of efficient strategies to improve health status by promoting health literacy in community-dwelling older adults.},

Semantic constraints also eliminated the word-frequency effect of a larger N400 for low-frequency words. Responses to closed-class words exhibited reduced N400 amplitudes in syntactic and congruent sentences, indicating that formal sentence structure placed greater restrictions on closed-class words than it did on open-class words. However, unlike the open-class results, the impact of sentence context on closed-class words was stable across word positions, suggesting that these syntactic constraints were applied only locally. A second ERP component, distinct from the N400, was elicited primarily by congruent closed-class words.},

We put forward specific recommendations such as publishing findings with minimum a priori aggregation and exploring the limits of predictive models without being constrained by parsimony and intuitiveness but instead maximizing out?of?sample predictive accuracy. We argue that naturally occurring variance in many decontextualized and multidetermined constructs that interest personality scientists may not have individual causes, at least as this term is generally understood and in ways that are human?interpretable, never mind intervenable. If so, useful explanations are narratives that summarize many pieces of descriptive findings rather than models that target individual cause?effect associations. By meticulously studying specific and contextualized behaviours, thoughts, feelings and goals, however, individual causes of variance may ultimately be identifiable, although such causal explanations will likely be far more complex, phenomenon?specific and person?specific than anticipated thus far. Progress in all three areas?description, prediction and explanation?requires higher dimensional models than the currently dominant ?Big Few? and supplementing subjective trait?ratings with alternative sources of information such as informant?reports and behavioural measurements. Developing a new generation of psychometric tools thus provides many immediate research opportunities. ? 2020 European Association of Personality Psychology},

In the present study, we used intensive longitudinal data (N = 104 college-age adults at a midwestern university; total assessments = 5,971) and three machine-learning approaches to investigate the degree to which three future behaviors and experiences?loneliness, procrastination, and studying?could be predicted from past psychological (i.e., personality and affective states), situational (i.e., objective situations and psychological situation cues), and time (i.e., trends, diurnal cycles, time of day, and day of the week) phenomena from an idiographic, person-specific perspective. Rather than pitting persons against situations, such an approach allows psychological phenomena, situations, and time to jointly predict future behaviors and experiences. We found (a) a striking degree of prediction accuracy across participants, (b) that a majority of participants? future behaviors are predicted by both person and situation features, and (c) that the most important features vary greatly across people.},

	abstract = {Comparative research involving consensually non-monogamous (CNM) relationships and outcomes related to well-being continues to grow as an area of interest within sexual science. However, claims of sameness and/or difference between groups rely on two critical, yet widely under-appreciated assumptions: that the concepts being compared between groups are the same (i.e., measurement invariance), and that logically and statistically coherent procedures are used for evaluating sameness (i.e., equivalence testing). We evaluated the state of measurement invariance and equivalence across three studies, involving different types of CNM comparisons (i.e., relationship types, partner types) and designs (analysis of primary individual data, primary dyadic data, and secondary data). Our invariance tests of CNM compared to monogamous individuals (Study 1) and “primary” compared to “secondary” partners in dyadic appraisal of CNM individuals (Study 2) revealed that many measures of well-being failed to replicate their measurement models and were not generalizable across relationship types or partner types. Our reanalyses of existing comparative CNM effects using individual and meta-analyzed equivalence tests (Study 3), meanwhile, indicated that this literature requires more consistent reporting practices and larger samples, as most studies produced uninformative tests of equivalence. Our results illustrate the importance of auxiliary hypothesis evaluation and statistical procedure selection for generating informative comparative tests. Our findings also highlight potential divergences in social construction of well-being. We offer suggestions for researchers, reviewers, and editors in terms of needed methodological reforms for future comparative CNM research.},

	abstract = {Aims: To compare clinical, psychological, education and social variables in emerging adults (aged 18–30years) with Type 1 diabetes with their adult counterparts aged {\textgreater}30years. Methods: A single assessment multinational sample was surveyed as part of the larger second Diabetes Attitudes, Wishes and Needs (DAWN2) study. Participants completed a series of surveys incorporating demographic as well as clinical questions (comorbidities, hypoglycaemia) and validated self-report scales concerning psychosocial (health impact, quality of life, beliefs and attitudes, self-management behaviours, healthcare experience and family support) and diabetes education factors. Results: Emerging adults differed from adults aged {\textgreater}30years with regard to a number of psychosocial variables. Emerging adults reported better overall quality of life, social support and support from their healthcare team compared with adults aged {\textgreater}30years of age; however, emerging adults experienced greater diabetes-specific distress and were less engaged in self-management. Diabetes education was related to a number of indicators, while experience of discrimination was harmful, but these impacts did not differ between emerging adults and adults aged {\textgreater}30years. An analysis of geographical regions suggested that emerging adults in North America and Europe had better well-being than older adults, while the opposite was observed in Asia. Conclusions: Emerging adults, particularly those in the later phase (ages 25–30years) are especially at risk in terms of diabetes-specific distress. There is a need for novel interventions to meet the needs of these vulnerable emerging adults more effectively.},

Diabetes distress (DD) is the concept that captures the emotional burden, frustrations, and worries resulting from living with T1D. This integrative review sets out to examine the impact of developmental context by answering this question: How do the challenges of emerging adulthood inform our understanding of DD? RECENT FINDINGS: DD is highly prevalent in emerging adults and occurs at higher rates than in other age groups. Qualitative studies reveal that DD is embedded within the developmental challenges specific to living with T1D during this stage. Quantitative studies reveal the prevalence and correlates of DD in this age group, and qualitative studies augment these findings by capturing the scope and complexity of the emotional burden of living with T1D as an emerging adult.},

	abstract = {Extensive research has focused on the potential benefits of education on various mental and physical health outcomes. However, whether the associations reflect a causal effect is harder to establish. To examine associations between educational duration and specific aspects of well-being, anxiety and mood disorders, and cardiovascular health in UK Biobank data, we apply four different causal inference methods (a natural policy experiment leveraging the minimum school leaving age, a sibling-control design, mendelian randomization (MR), and within-family MR), and assess if the methods converge on the same conclusion. A comparison of results across the four methods reveals that associations between educational duration and these outcomes appears predominantly to be the result of confounding or bias rather than a true causal effect of education on well-being and health outcomes. Whereas we do consistently find no associations between educational duration and happiness, family satisfaction, work satisfaction, meaning in life, depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder, we do not find consistent significant associations across all methods for the other phenotypes (health satisfaction, financial satisfaction, friendship satisfaction, neuroticism, and cardiovascular outcomes). We discuss inconsistencies in results across methods considering their respective limitations and biases, and additionally discuss the generalizability of our findings in light of the sample and phenotype limitations. Overall, this study strengthens the idea that triangulation across different methods is necessary to enhance our understanding of the causal consequences of educational duration.},

	abstract = {Intensive longitudinal data (ILD) have become popular for studying within-person dynamics in psychological constructs (or between-person differences therein). Before investigating the dynamics, it is crucial to examine whether the measurement model (MM) is the same across subjects and time and, thus, whether the measured constructs have the same meaning. If the MM differs (e.g., because of changes in item interpretation or response styles), observations cannot be validly compared. Exploring differences in the MM for ILD can be done with latent Markov factor analysis (LMFA), which classifies observations based on the underlying MM (for many subjects and time points simultaneously) and thus shows which observations are comparable. However, the complexity of the method or the fact that no open-source software for LMFA existed until now may have hindered researchers from applying the method in practice. In this article, we provide a step-by-step tutorial for the new user-friendly software package lmfa, which allows researchers to easily perform the analysis LMFA in the freely available software R to investigate MM differences in their own ILD.},

	issn = {0012-186X},
	doi = {10.1007/s00125-022-05685-7},
	abstract = {Monitoring of glucose plays an essential role in the management of diabetes. However, to fully understand and meaningfully interpret glucose levels, additional information on context is necessary. Important contextual factors include data on behaviours such as eating, exercise, medication-taking and sleep, as well as data on mental health aspects such as stress, affect, diabetes distress and depressive symptoms. This narrative review provides an overview of the current state and future directions of precision monitoring in diabetes. Precision monitoring of glucose has made great progress over the last 5 years with the emergence of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), automated analysis of new glucose variables and visualisation of CGM data via the ambulatory glucose profile. Interestingly, there has been little progress in the identification of subgroups of people with diabetes based on their glycaemic profile. The integration of behavioural and mental health data could enrich such identification of subgroups to stimulate precision medicine. There are a handful of studies that have used innovative methodology such as ecological momentary assessment to monitor behaviour and mental health in people’s everyday life. These studies indicate the importance of the interplay between behaviour, mental health and glucose. However, automated integration and intelligent interpretation of these data sources are currently not available. Automated integration of behaviour, mental health and glucose could lead to the identification of certain subgroups that, for example, show a strong association between mental health and glucose in contrast to subgroups that show independence of mental health and glucose. This could inform precision diagnostics and precision therapeutics. We identified just-in-time adaptive interventions as a potential means by which precision monitoring could lead to precision therapeutics. Just-in-time adaptive interventions consist of micro-interventions that are triggered in people’s everyday lives when a certain problem is identified using monitored behaviour, mental health and glucose variables. Thus, these micro-interventions are responsive to real-life circumstances and are adaptive to the specific needs of an individual with diabetes. We conclude that, with current developments in big data analysis, there is a huge potential for precision monitoring in diabetes.},

	abstract = {Background. Although there has been increasing interest in patient engagement, few measures are publicly available and suitable for patients with limited health literacy. Objective. We sought to develop a Consumer Health Activation Index (CHAI) for use among diverse patients. Methods. Expert opinion, a systematic literature review, focus groups, and cognitive interviews with patients were used to create and revise a potential set of items. Psychometric testing guided by item response theory was then conducted among 301 English-speaking, community-dwelling adults. This included differential item functioning analyses to evaluate item performance across participant health literacy levels. To determine construct validity, CHAI scores were compared to scales measuring similar personality constructs. Associations between the CHAI and physical and mental health established predictive validity. A second study among 9,478 adults was used to confirm CHAI associations with health outcomes. Results. Exploratory factor analyses revealed a single-factor solution with a 10-item scale. The CHAI showed good internal consistency (alpha = 0.81) and moderate test–retest reliability (ICC = 0.53). Reading grade level was found to be at the 6th grade. Moderate to strong correlations were found with similar constructs (Multidimensional Health Locus of Control, r = 0.38, P ¡ 0.001; Conscientiousness, r = 0.41, P ¡ 0.001). Predictive validity was demonstrated through associations with functional health status measures (depression, r = −0.28, P ¡ 0.001; anxiety, r = −0.22, P ¡ 0.001; and physical functioning, r = 0.22, P ¡ 0.001). In the validation sample, the CHAI was significantly associated with self-reported physical and mental health (r = 0.31 and 0.32 respectively; both P ¡ 0.001). Conclusions. The CHAI appears to be a valid, reliable, and easily administered tool that can be used to assess health activation among adults, including those with limited health literacy. Future studies should test the tool in actual use and explore further applications.},

The aim is to identify distinct patterns of glycemic control in type 1 diabetes from childhood to young adulthood. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 6,433 patients with type 1 diabetes were selected from the prospective, multicenter diabetes patient registry Diabetes-Patienten-Verlaufsdokumentation (DPV) (follow-up from age 8 to 19 years, baseline diabetes duration ≥2 years, HbA1c aggregated per year of life). We used latent class growth modeling as the trajectory approach to determine distinct subgroups following a similar trajectory for HbA1c over time. RESULTS Five distinct longitudinal trajectories of HbA1c were determined, comprising group 1 = 40\%, group 2 = 27\%, group 3 = 15\%, group 4 = 13\%, and group 5 = 5\% of patients. Groups 1–3 indicated stable glycemic control at different HbA1c levels. At baseline, similar HbA1c was observed in group 1 and group 4, but HbA1c deteriorated in group 4 from age 8 to 19 years. Similar patterns were present in group 3 and group 5. We observed differences in self-monitoring of blood glucose, insulin therapy, daily insulin dose, physical activity, BMI SD score, body-height SD score, and migration background across all HbA1c trajectories (all P ≤ 0.001). No sex differences were present. Comparing groups with similar initial HbA1c but different patterns, groups with higher HbA1c increase were characterized by lower frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose and physical activity and reduced height (all P ¡ 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Using a trajectory approach, we determined five distinct longitudinal patterns of glycemic control from childhood to early adulthood. Diabetes self-care, treatment differences, and demographics were related to different HbA1c courses.},

High school seniors with type 1 diabetes (N = 236; mean age 17.74 years) were assessed at three yearly time points. At baseline, during the senior year of high school, participants completed a self-report measure of problems with EF and performance-based measures of EF and general intelligence (IQ). Glycemic control was determined on the basis of results collected from HbA1c assay kits, and teens reported their adherence at all three time points. HbA1c increased significantly across the three time points and adherence declined. EF performance was not associated with adherence or HbA1c at baseline, nor with changes in adherence over time. However, better EF performance predicted slower increases in HbA1c over time (i.e., slope) while controlling for IQ. Teens’ self-reported problems with EF were associated with worse glycemic control and poorer adherence at baseline (i.e., intercept), but they did not predict changes in either HbA1c or adherence over time (i.e., slope). Abilities involved in performance on EF tests may be one resource for maintaining better glycemic control during the transition to emerging adulthood. Assessment of such EF abilities may allow for the identification of individuals who are most at risk for deterioration of glycemic control during this transition.},

	volume = {44},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE
To identify correlates of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testing frequency and associations with HbA1c levels and microvascular complications in youth-onset diabetes.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study collected data from individuals diagnosed with diabetes before age 20 at 8 years (n = 1,885 type 1, n = 230 type 2) and 13 years (n = 649 type 1, n = 84 type 2) diabetes duration. We identified correlates of reporting ≥3 HbA1c tests/year using logistic regression. We examined associations of HbA1c testing with HbA1c levels and microvascular complications (retinopathy, neuropathy, or nephropathy) using sequentially adjusted linear and logistic regression.

RESULTS
For type 1 diabetes, odds of reporting ≥3 HbA1c tests/year at 8 and 13 years diabetes duration decreased with older age at diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] 0.91 [95\% CI 0.88–0.95]), longer duration of diabetes (OR 0.90 [0.82–0.99]), not having a personal doctor (OR 0.44 [0.30–0.65]), and lapses in health insurance (OR 0.51 [0.27–0.96]). HbA1c testing ≥3 times/year over time was associated with lower HbA1c levels (OR −0.36\% [−0.65 to −0.06]) and lower odds of microvascular complications (OR 0.64 [0.43–0.97]) at 13 years’ duration, but associations were attenuated after adjustment for HbA1c testing correlates (OR −0.17 [−0.46 to 0.13] and 0.70 [0.46–1.07], respectively). For type 2 diabetes, not seeing an endocrinologist decreased the odds of reporting ≥3 HbA1c tests/year over time (OR 0.19 [0.06–0.63]), but HbA1c testing frequency was not associated with HbA1c levels or microvascular complications.

CONCLUSIONS
We observed disparities in HbA1c testing frequency predominately by health care–related factors, which were associated with diabetes outcomes in type 1 diabetes.},

The analysis reveals that processes related to automatic hostile interpretations, ruminative attention, and effortful control appear to be important contributors to individual differences in angry reactivity.

Higher levels of conscientiousness moderated two of the other trait main effects. Personality, trait change, and interactions among traits reliably forecasted 10-year substance-use behaviors.},

There are, however, mixed and negative results. Following a critical summary of epidemiological findings, the present article discusses the construct and measurement overlap among the 3 negative affects. Recognition of the overlap necessitates the development of more complex affect-disease models and has implications for the interpretation of prior studies, statistical analyses, prevention, and intervention in health psychology and behavioral medicine. The overlap among the 3 negative dispositions also leaves open the possibility that a general disposition toward negative affectivity may be more important for disease risk than any specific negative affect.},

The results supported several conclusions. First, late childhood and adolescence were key periods. Across these years, age trends for some traits (a) were especially pronounced, (b) were in a direction different from the corresponding adult trends, or (c) first indicated the presence of gender differences. Second, there were some negative trends in psychosocial maturity from late childhood into adolescence, whereas adult trends were overwhelmingly in the direction of greater maturity and adjustment. Third, the related but distinguishable facet traits within each broad Big Five domain often showed distinct age trends, highlighting the importance of facet-level research for understanding life span age differences in personality.},

By drawing on the principles of dynamic systems theory, we present Personality Dynamics model – a novel framework that captures people's typical pattern of changes in personality states using three model parameters: baseline personality, reflecting the stable set point around which one's states fluctuate, personality variability, or the extent to which one's personality states fluctuate across time and situations, and personality attractor force, pertaining to the swiftness with which deviations of one's baseline are pulled back to the baseline. We argue that the dynamic approach to personality represented in the PersDyn model has the potential to integrate different perspectives on individual differences. We also demonstrate that the dynamic approach to personality offers a consensual paradigm of personality with the potential to advance our understanding and knowledge of individual differences, by detailing the factors and processes included in the model, as well as links to existing theories and applications in various research lines.},

Our analyses shed new light on psychosocial processes yielding results that are face valid (e.g., subjects living in high elevations talk about the mountains), tie in with other research (e.g., neurotic people disproportionately use the phrase ‘sick of’ and the word ‘depressed’), suggest new hypotheses (e.g., an active life implies emotional stability), and give detailed insights (males use the possessive ‘my’ when mentioning their ‘wife’ or ‘girlfriend’ more often than females use ‘my’ with ‘husband’ or 'boyfriend’).

As in past research, conscientiousness predicted better health and physical functioning, whereas neuroticism predicted worse health and physical functioning. Unique to this study was the finding that conscientiousness demonstrated a compensatory effect, such that husbands' conscientiousness predicted wives' health outcomes above and beyond wives' own personality. The same pattern held true for wives' conscientiousness as a predictor of husbands' health outcomes. Furthermore, conscientiousness and neuroticism acted synergistically, such that people who scored high for both traits were healthier than others. Finally, we found that the combination of high conscientiousness and high neuroticism was also compensatory, such that the wives of men with this combination of personality traits reported better health than other women.},

However, recent work suggests that people's level of neuroticism changes over long periods of time. We hypothesized that such changes in trait neuroticism affect mortality risk. Growth-curve parameters (levels and slopes) that quantified the trajectories of neuroticism change over 12 years were used to predict 18-year risk of mortality among 1,663 aging men. Proportional hazards models were used to estimate mortality risk from level and slope parameters, controlling for objective and subjective health, depression, and age. Although a parallel analysis of extraversion showed no significant effects, level and slope of neuroticism interacted in their effect on mortality. Men who had both a high average level of neuroticism and an increasing level of neuroticism over time had much lower survival than men without that combination. These findings suggest that it is not just the level of personality traits, but their direction of change, that is related to mortality.},

Effects of children's self-control could be disentangled from their intelligence and social class as well as from mistakes they made as adolescents. In another cohort of 500 sibling-pairs, the sibling with lower self-control had poorer outcomes, despite shared family background.

Three hundred and twenty-one men and women, divided among young, middle-aged, and older adults, rated themselves on these measures along with six instruments prominent in earlier studies (i.e., affect balance, life satisfaction, self-esteem, morale, locus of control, depression). Results revealed that positive relations with others, autonomy, purpose in life, and personal growth were not strongly tied to prior assessment indexes, thereby supporting the claim that key aspects of positive functioning have not been represented in the empirical arena.

Application of the five-factor model of personality to adherence research will reduce divergence in the field and aid in the orientation and interpretation of future work. Evidence suggests that an interactive perspective recognizing the moderating influence of contextual factors on the behavioral expression of personality traits will contribute to the prediction of adherence behavior.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Previous research has found that conscientiousness has positive associations with preventative health-related behaviors and self-perceived health, but little is known about the links between changes in these variables over time. In the present study, we examined how levels and changes in conscientiousness were linked to levels and changes in both preventative health-related behaviors and self-perceived physical health. METHOD: Personality and health questionnaires were administered to participants in two waves, with an interval of approximately three years. Participants ranged in age from 19 to 94. To elucidate the tripartite relations between conscientiousness, preventative health-related behaviors, and self-perceived physical health, we used latent change models to estimate levels and changes of these latent constructs over time. RESULTS: Changes in conscientiousness were significantly and positively correlated with changes in preventative health behaviors and changes in self-perceived physical health. Changes in preventative health behaviors partially mediated the relation between changes in conscientiousness and changes in self-perceived physical health. CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal study extends previous research on conscientiousness and health by exploring the relations between latent variables over a 3-year period. It provides evidence that increases in conscientiousness and preventative health-related behaviors are associated with improvements in self-perceived health over the same time period.},

We review evidence for the content and the structure of conflict and compatibility among values found across cultures. We discuss the assumptions underlying the many instruments developed to measure values. We then consider the origins of value priorities and their stability or change over time. The remainder of the review presents the evidence for the ways personal values relate to personality traits and subjective well-being and the implications of value differences for religiosity, prejudice, pro- and antisocial behavior, political and environmental behavior, and creativity, concluding with a discussion of mechanisms that link values to behavior.},

We were able to reproduce and replicate the findings based on a difference-score approach. However, we did not find a similarity effect in either sample using more sophisticated approaches.

	abstract = {Abstract. In pursuit of a more systematic and comprehensive framework for personality assessment, we introduce procedures for assessing personality traits at the lowest level: nuances. We argue that constructing a personality taxonomy from the bottom up addresses some of the limitations of extant top-down assessment frameworks (e.g., the Big Five), including the opportunity to resolve confusion about the breadth and scope of traits at different levels of the organization, evaluate unique and reliable trait variance at the item level, and clarify jingle/jangle issues in personality assessment. With a focus on applications in survey methodology and transparent documentation, our procedures contain six steps: (1) identification of a highly inclusive pool of candidate items, (2) programmatic evaluation and documentation of item characteristics, (3) test-retest analyses of items with adequate qualitative and quantitative properties, (4) analysis of cross-ratings from multiple raters for items with adequate retest reliability, (5) aggregation of ratings across diverse samples to evaluate generalizability across populations, (6) evaluations of predictive utility in various contexts. We hope these recommendations are the first step in a collaborative effort to identify a comprehensive pool of personality nuances at the lowest level, enabling subsequent construction of a robust hierarchy – from the bottom up.},

	abstract = {For the past two decades the person-situation debate has dominated personality psychology and had important repercussions in clinical, social, and organizational psychology. This controversy strikes to the heart of each of these disciplines because it puts on trial the central assumption that internal dispositions have an important influence on behavior. According to emerging views of scientific progress, controversy serves the useful function of narrowing the field of competing hypotheses. In this light, we examine seven hypotheses that arose during the course of the person-situation debate, rangingfrom most to least pessimistic about the existence o f consensual, discriminative personality traits. The accumulated evidencefails to support the hypotheses that personality traits are simply (a) in the eye of the beholder, (b) semantic illusions, (c) artifacts of base-rate accuracy, (d) artifacts of shared stereotypes, (e) due to discussion between observers (who ignore behavior in favor of verbal self-presentation or reputation), or (f) mere by-products of situational consistencies. Evidence also fails to support the hypothesis (g) that although traits are related to behavior, the relationship is too small to be important. Yet we have not simply come full circle to a reacceptance o f traits as they were understood 20 years ago. Research generated by these hypotheses has allowed us to better specify the circumstances under which personality assessments will be valid.},

Brain inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Hypothesizing therefore that long-term exposure to fine PM might contribute to the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the objective of this study was to investigate the association between exposure to fine PM and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) which is associated with a high risk of progression to AD. A study group of 399 women aged 68–79 years who lived for more than 20 years at the same residential address has been assessed for long-term exposure to PM and tested for MCI. The exposure assessment comprised background concentration of PM10 and traffic-related PM indicated by the distance of the residential address to the next busy road. The women were assessed for MCI by a battery of several neuropsychological tests and their odor identification ability. Consistent effects of traffic-related air pollution exposure on test performances including a dose–response relation were found. The associations were adjusted for potential confounders using regression analysis. These results indicate that chronic exposure to traffic-related PM may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD.},

Using data from the Health and Retirement Study (n = 20,422; mean age = 65.9 years), we examined the longitudinal relationships between Big Five personality trait levels and perceived support from children, family, friends, and spouses. Results found that participants who reported more positive social support and lower negative support also tended to score higher on conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and openness to experience, but lower on neuroticism. Moreover, changes in positive support across relationship partners coincided with trait changes over time, in the form of more positive support was associated with seemingly adaptive changes on the Big Five. Findings are discussed with respect to identifying social influences on personality development in adulthood.},

	abstract = {Scholars from across the social and media sciences have issued a clarion call to address a recent resurgence in criminalized characterizations of immigrants. Do these characterizations meaningfully impact individuals’ beliefs about immigrants and immigration? Across two online convenience samples (total N = 1,054 adult U.S. residents), we applied a novel analytic technique to test how different narratives—achievement, criminal, and struggle-oriented—impacted cognitive representations of German, Russian, Syrian, and Mexican immigrants and the concept of immigrants in general. All stories featured male targets. Achievement stories homogenized individual immigrant representations, whereas both criminal and struggle-oriented stories racialized them along a White/non-White axis: Germany clustered with Russia, and Syria clustered with Mexico. However, criminal stories were unique in making our most egalitarian participants’ representations as differentiated as our least egalitarian participants’. Narratives about individual immigrants also generalized to update representations of nationality groups. Most important, narrative-induced representations correlated with immigration-policy preferences: Achievement narratives and corresponding homogenized representations promoted preferences for less restriction, and criminal narratives promoted preferences for more.},

	abstract = {Self-report measures directly ask respondents to report their mental content, such as thoughts and feelings. By contrast, implicit measures aim to assess thoughts and feelings using performance indicators (for example, response times, error rates and response frequencies) under conditions that favour automatic processing. Implicit measures are now widely used in psychological science and beyond, because they are assumed to be superior to self-reports in various ways. In this Perspective, we argue that, despite the enthusiasm for implicit measures, self-reports are most often the better measurement option. First, the use of implicit measures is often based on mistaken assumptions about the disadvantages of self-reports. Second, self-reports have advantageous characteristics that are currently unmatched in implicit measures. We call for a more sophisticated use of self-reports and for caution when using implicit measures in basic and applied research.},

	abstract = {We describe three studies that together provide a ﬁrst approximation to a comprehensive taxonomy of unique personality facets. In Study 1, we semantically sorted, removed synonyms, and factor analysed 1772 personality items taken from seven major omnibus personality inventories and four narrow inventories. Study 1 identiﬁed 61 base facets. In Study 2, we conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify facets missing from the 61 base facets. We identiﬁed 16 novel facets. We then created standardised, open access items for the 77 facets. In Study 3, we administered the items to a novel sample (N = 1096) and assessed the psychometric properties of the facets. The ultimate result was 70 personality facet scales that are open access, psychometrically robust, unidimensional, and discriminant. We call this inventory the Facet-level Multidimensional Assessment of Personality or Facet MAP, version 1. The Facet MAP contains scales equivalent to almost all scales present in major personality inventories, and in most cases, many more as well. As the Facet MAP develops, we hope it will eventually provide a comprehensive taxonomy of personality facets, which will prove useful in reducing construct proliferation and facilitating numerous avenues of important personality research. The Facet MAP items and user manual can be found at: facetmap.org.},

We discuss practical advantages of the Bayesian approach over frequentist methods and conceptual differences. We demonstrate how Bayesian statistics can help EMA researchers to (a) incorporate prior knowledge and beliefs in analyses, (b) fit models with a large variety of outcome distributions that reflect likely data-generating processes, (c) quantify the uncertainty of effect-size estimates, and (d) quantify the evidence for or against an informative hypothesis. We present a workflow for Bayesian analyses and provide illustrative examples based on EMA data, which we analyze using (generalized) linear mixed-effects models to test whether daily self-control demands predict three different alcohol outcomes. All examples are reproducible, and data and code are available at https://osf.io/rh2sw/ . Having worked through this tutorial, readers should be able to adopt a Bayesian workflow to their own analysis of EMA data.},

	abstract = {In psychology, we often want to know whether or not an effect exists. The traditional way of answering this question is to use frequentist statistics. However, a signiﬁcance test against a null hypothesis of no effect cannot distinguish between two states of affairs: evidence of absence of an effect and the absence of evidence for or against an effect. Bayes factors can make this distinction; however, uptake of Bayes factors in psychology has so far been low for two reasons. First, they require researchers to specify the range of effect sizes their theory predicts. Researchers are often unsure about how to do this, leading to the use of inappropriate default values which may give misleading results. Second, many implementations of Bayes factors have a substantial technical learning curve. We present a case study and simulations demonstrating a simple method for generating a range of plausible effect sizes, that is, a model of Hypothesis 1, for treatment effects where there is a binary-dependent variable. We illustrate this using mainly the estimates from frequentist logistic mixed-effects models (because of their widespread adoption) but also using Bayesian model comparison with Bayesian hierarchical models (which have increased ﬂexibility). Bayes factors calculated using these estimates provide intuitively reasonable results across a range of real effect sizes.},
