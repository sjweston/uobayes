Through a combination of theoretical foundations and hands-on programming, students learn to build, interpret, and critique Bayesian models using the R programming language, with particular emphasis on the brms package.\n\n## Course Structure\n\nThis course is a mix of asynchronous lectures, in-class activities, and homework assignments:\n\n- Before each class, you will watch a video lecture. These will be posted on the course website alongside each lecture.\n- At the beginning of each class, there will be a short quiz to check your understanding of the lecture and help me know what to review.\n- Class time will be used for in-class activities, including group work and discussion.\n- Each week will have a homework assignment. These will be posted on Canvas.\n- You can find all the materials for each week on the course website.\n\n## Materials\n\n**Required:**\n\n- R and RStudio (free)\n- Required R packages:\n  - rethinking\n  - brms\n  - tidybase\n  - tidyverse\n\n**Recommended:**\n\n- _Statistical Rethinking_ by Richard McElreath (2nd ed.)\n\nAdditional course materials, including lecture notes and code, will be provided on the course website.\n\n## Assignment Submission\n\n- All assignments should be submitted through Canvas\n- Submissions must be in PDF format, knitted from R Markdown\n- Assignments are posted on Friday and due the following Monday at 11:59pm\n- There is a one-week grace period for each assignment\n\n## Grading\n\n- **Homework (95%)**\n  - 10 assignments\n  - Graded on completion (not accuracy)\n  - Posted on Friday, due the following Monday at 11:59pm\n  - One week grace period for each assignment\n\n- **Quizzes (5%)**\n  - 19 quizzes\n  - Cover material from the day's recorded lecture\n  - Completed in class\n  - No makeup opportunities for missed quizzes\n\n## Slack\n\nI have created a [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/uobayes/shared_invite/zt-32fjkvou9-Kz5DV2PhdDuLsXKue93A7A) workspace for this course, open to anyone (registerd or not) who is attending. The goal of this space is for us to support each other as we learn the material. Anyone can post a question, and anyone can answer a question. I will not be as active here as I am in class, nor as responsive as I am over email. But if I see a question has the class stumped or it feels like an important concept hasn't clicked yet, I will update lecture materials to help us get on track. \n\nI especially encourage using this space to coordinate working on probelm sets together, sharing resources you find online, and sharing ways you've used technology (R/RMarkdown/AI) that have supported your research. I also encourage memes. \n\n## Course Policies\n\n### Communication\n\nIf you have questions about course policies, have trouble submitting an assignment, or want to schedule a meeting, please email. I will make an effort to respond to emails within one business day. Note that I neither plan nor commit to checking email outside of normal business hours (9am-5pm, Mon-Fri). \n\nIf you are having trouble understanding a concept covered in class, please come to office hours, schedule a meeting with me, ask for clarification during class periods, or use the class Slack to get help from the group. I will not explain course concepts over email.  \n\nOccasionally, I will send out announcements to the entire class via Canvas announcements. These will typically appear when you open Canvas, but you can update your Canvas settings to receive these announcements as emails. It is strongly recommended that you do so.\n\n### Classroom Expectations\n\nAll members of the class (students and instructor) can expect to:\n\n**Participate and Contribute:** All students are expected to participate by sharing ideas and contributing to the learning environment. This entails preparing, following instructions, and engaging respectfully and thoughtfully with others. \n\nWhile all students should participate, participation is not just talking, and a range of participation activities support learning. Participation might look like speaking aloud in the full class and in small groups and collaborating on homework assignments.\n\n**Expect and Respect Diversity:** All classes at the University of Oregon welcome and respect diverse experiences, perspectives, and approaches. What is not welcome are behaviors or contributions that undermine, demean, or marginalize others based on race, ethnicity, gender, sex, age, sexual orientation, religion, ability, or socioeconomic status. We will value differences and communicate disagreements with respect.  \n\n**Help Everyone Learn:** Part of how we learn together is by learning from one another. To do this effectively, we need to be patient with each other, identify ways we can assist others, and be open-minded to receiving help and feedback from others. Don't hesitate to contact me to ask for assistance or offer suggestions that might help us learn better.\n\n### Workload\n\nThis is a 3-credit hour course, so you should expect to complete 120 hours of work for the courseâ€”an average of about 12 hours each week (this includes time in-class). \n\n### Generative AI Policy\n\nWhile generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Cursor) can be useful for assisting with certain tasks, it's important to use these technologies responsibly and ethically.\n\n**Good uses of AI:**\n\n- Exploring concepts, generating code ideas, and providing explanations for topics covered in the course\n- Creating preliminary drafts of code, data analysis plans, or written reports (with review and testing)\n- Brainstorming research questions, identifying key terms, or helping summarize complex literature\n\n**Bad uses of AI:**\n\n- Generating entire assignments, projects, or reports without manual oversight\n- Using AI in place of collaborating with peers\n- Submitting AI-generated content without proper attribution\n\n**Required Disclosure:** Students who use AI tools must include a brief statement at the end of their submission describing how and where the tool was used. Failure to disclose AI use may result in grade reduction or disciplinary action.\n\n### Academic Integrity\n\nFrankly, you're in graduate school, and the purpose of work is to create opportunities to learn and improve. Even if cheating helps you in the short term, you'll quickly find yourself ill-prepared for the career you have chosen. If you find yourself tempted to cheat, please come speak to Dr. Weston about an extension and developing tools to improve your success.\n\n### Accessibility\n\nThe University of Oregon and I are dedicated to fostering inclusive learning environments for all students and welcomes students with disabilities into all of the University's educational programs. The Accessible Education Center (AEC) assists students with disabilities in reducing campus-wide and classroom-related barriers.
