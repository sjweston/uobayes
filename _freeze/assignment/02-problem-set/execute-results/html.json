Make sure you reserve code chunks for code and write out any interpretations or explanations outside of code chunks. Submit the knitted PDF file containing your code and written answers on Canvas. \n\n## Questions\n\nFrom the `Howell1` dataset, consider only people younger than 13 years old. Estimate the causal association between age and weight. Assume that age influences weight through two paths. First, age influences height, and\nheight influences weight. Second, age directly influences weight through age-related changes in muscle growth and body proportions. \n\n1. Write a generative simulation that takes age as an input and simulates height and weight.\n\n2. Write out a mathematical model to estimate the relationship between age and weight. \n\n3. Fit this model using `brms`. Create two plots: one of regression lines implied by your prior and one of the regression lines implied by the posterior.\n",
