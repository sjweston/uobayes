But is this association causal? One plausible confound is that education is also associated with age, through a causal process: People are older when they finish school than when they begin it. Reconsider the Trolley data in this light. Draw a DAG that represents hypothetical causal relationships among response, education, and age. Which statistical model or models do you need to evaluate the causal influence of education on responses? Fit these models to the trolley data. What do you conclude about the causal relationships among these three variables?\n",
