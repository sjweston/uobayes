Make sure you reserve code chunks for code and write out any interpretations or explainations outside of code chunks. Submit the knitted PDF file containing your code and written answers on Canvas. \n\n## Questions\n\n1. Return to `data(Trolley)`. Define and fit a varying intercepts model for these data. Cluster intercepts on individual participants, as indicated by the unique values in the `id` variable. Include `action`, `intention`, and `contact` as ordinary terms. Compare the varying intercepts model and a model that ignores individuals, using both WAIC and posterior predictions. What is the impact of individual variation in these data?\n\n2. The `Trolley` data are also clustered by `story`, which indicates a unique narrative for each vignette. Define and fit a cross-classified varying intercepts model with both `id` and `story.` Use the same ordinary terms as in the previous problem. Compare this model to the previous models. What do you infer about the impact of different stories on responses?\n",
