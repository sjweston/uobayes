According to McElreath, there are 3 steps. (See here for his explaination, but I'll try to help here too):\n\n### Install C++ toolchain\n\nYou might have one of these already. On a Mac, check by opening the Terminal app and running this code:\n\n```\nclang++ --version\n```\n\nIf you get anything other than `command not found`, you're gold.\n\n* On a Mac, download and install the app Xcode. \n* On a Windows, install C++ in [Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation?view=msvc-170).\n\n### Install `CmdStanR`\n\nIn R, run this code:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"cmdstanr\", \n                 repos = c('https://stan-dev.r-universe.dev', getOption(\"repos\")))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Install `rethinking`\n\nIn R, run this code:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"shape\")\ninstall.packages(\"rethinking\", \n                 repos=c(cran=\"https://cloud.r-project.org\",\n                         rethinking=\"http://xcelab.net/R\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nIf you're asked whether you want to install from these sources (compilation of C/C++/Fortran), say yes.\n\n### Install `brms` and `tidybayes`\n\nWhile you're here, install these packages for later.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(c(\"brms\", \"tidybayes\"))\n```\n:::\n",
