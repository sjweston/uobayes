First, some acknowledgements: this class is primarily built from the works of Richard McElreath and Solomon Kurz.

  - McElreath's [Statistical Rethinking (2024  version)](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2024/tree/main) course materials
  - [Kurz's translation](https://bookdown.org/content/4857/) of SR into `brms` and `tidybayes`

I also recommend bookmarking [the `tidybayes` site](https://mjskay.github.io/tidybayes/).

The rest of this section contains resources and tutorials. Some were developed by [Andrew Heiss](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/), whose website code I used to develop this class website. (Bookmark his site too and check it regularly. You'll never know what you'll learn from him, but it'll always make your science better.)

Here are some additional Bayes resources to check out:

  - [This new *Bayes Rules* book](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/) is designed to be an introductory textbook for a stats class teaching Bayesian stuff. Itâ€™s really accessible and good (and free!). 

  - [This post from 2016](https://thinkinator.com/2016/01/12/r-users-will-now-inevitably-become-bayesians/) is a great short introduction. 

  - [This post shows how to do one simple task](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2019/01/29/diff-means-half-dozen-ways/) (a difference-in-means test) with regular old frequentist methods, bootstrapping, and with Bayesian stats both with brms and raw Stan code

  - [This short post](https://www.tjmahr.com/bayes-theorem-in-three-panels/) gives a helpful overview of the intuition behind Bayesianism

  - [*The Theory That Would Not Die*](https://www.amazon.com/Theory-That-Would-Not-Die/dp/0300188226) is a fun little general introduction to the history of Bayesianism and why it kind of disappeared in the 20th century and was replaced by frequentism and p-values and null hypothesis testing
