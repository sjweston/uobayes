    "text": "DAGs with R, ggdag, and dagitty\nYou can use the ggdag and dagitty packages in R to build and work with DAGs too. I typically draw an initial DAG in my browser with dagitty.net and then I rewrite it in code in R so that it’s more official and formal and reproducible.\n\nLive coding example\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic DAGs\n(This is a heavily cleaned up and annotated version of the code from the video.)\n\n\nCode\n# Load packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)  # For dplyr, ggplot, and friends\nlibrary(ggdag)      # For plotting DAGs\nlibrary(dagitty)    # For working with DAG logic\n\n\nThe general process for making and working with DAGs in R is to create a DAG object with dagify() and then plot it with ggdag(). The documentation for ggdag is really good and helpful and full of examples. Check these pages for all sorts of additional details:\n\n“An introduction to ggdag”\n“An introduction to directed acyclic graphs”\nList of all ggdag-related functions\n\nThe syntax for dagify() is similar to the formula syntax you’ve been using for building regression models with lm(). The formulas you use in dagify() indicate the relationships between nodes.\nFor instance, in this DAG, y is caused by x, a, and b (y ~ x + a + b), and x is caused by a and b (x ~ a + b). This means that a and b are confounders. Use the exposure and outcome arguments to specify which nodes are the exposure (or treatment/intervention/program) and the outcome.\n\n\nCode\n# Create super basic DAG\nsimple_dag &lt;- dagify(\n  y ~ x + a + b,\n  x ~ a + b,\n  exposure = \"x\",\n  outcome = \"y\"\n)\n\n# Adding a theme_dag() layer to the plot makes it have a white background with no axis labels\nggdag(simple_dag) +\n  theme_dag()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to plot which nodes are the exposure and outcome, use ggdag_status() instead:\n\n\nCode\nggdag_status(simple_dag) +\n  theme_dag()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLayouts and manual coordinates\nNotice how the layout is different in both of those graphs. By default, ggdag() positions the nodes randomly every time using a network algorithm. You can change the algorithm by using the layout argument: ggdag(simple_dag, layout = \"nicely\"). You can see a full list of possible algorithms by running ?layout_tbl_graph_igraph in the console.\nAlternatively, you can specify your own coordinates so that the nodes are positioned in the same place every time. Do this with the coords argument in dagify().\nThe best way to figure out what these numbers should be is to draw the DAG on paper or on a whiteboard and add a grid to it and then figure out the coordinates. For instance, in this DAG there are three rows and three columns: x and y go in the middle row (row 2) while a and b go in the middle column (column 2). It can also be helpful to not include theme_dag() at first so you can see the numbers for the underlying grid. Once you have everything positioned correctly, add theme_dag() to clean it up.\n\n\nCode\nsimple_dag_with_coords &lt;- dagify(\n  y ~ x + a + b,\n  x ~ a + b,\n  exposure = \"x\",\n  outcome = \"y\",\n  coords = list(x = c(x = 1, a = 2, b = 2, y = 3),\n                y = c(x = 2, a = 1, b = 3, y = 2))\n)\n\nggdag_status(simple_dag_with_coords) +\n  theme_dag()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNode names and labels\nThe variable names you use do not have to be limited to just x, y, and other lowercase letters. You can any names you want, as long as there are no spaces.\n\n\nCode\ndag_with_var_names &lt;- dagify(\n  outcome ~ treatment + confounder1 + confounder2,\n  treatment ~ confounder1 + confounder2,\n  exposure = \"treatment\",\n  outcome = \"outcome\"\n)\n\nggdag_status(dag_with_var_names) +\n  theme_dag()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, unless you use very short names, it is likely that the text will not fit inside the nodes. To get around this, you can add labels to the nodes using the labels argument in dagify(). Plot the labels by setting use_labels = \"label\" in ggdag(). You can turn off the text in the nodes with text = FALSE in ggdag().\n\n\nCode\ndag_with_coords_and_labels &lt;- dagify(\n  y ~ x + a + b,\n  x ~ a + b,\n  exposure = \"x\",\n  outcome = \"y\",\n  labels = c(y = \"Outcome\", x = \"Treatment\",\n             a = \"Confounder 1\", b = \"Confounder 2\"),\n  coords = list(x = c(x = 1, a = 2, b = 2, y = 3),\n                y = c(x = 2, a = 1, b = 3, y = 2))\n)\n\nggdag_status(dag_with_coords_and_labels,\n             use_labels = \"label\", text = FALSE) +\n  guides(fill = \"none\", color = \"none\") +  # Disable the legend\n  theme_dag()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaths and adjustment sets\nR can also perform analysis on DAG objects. For example, we can find all the testable implications from the DAG using the impliedConditionalIndependencies() function from the dagitty package. For this simple DAG, there is only one: a should be independent of b. If we had a dataset with columns for each of these variables, we could check if this is true by running cor(a, b) to see if the two are related.\n\n\nCode\nimpliedConditionalIndependencies(simple_dag)\n## a _||_ b\n\n\nWe can also find all the paths between x and y using the paths() function from the dagitty package. We can see that there are three open paths between x and y:\n\n\nCode\npaths(simple_dag)\n## $paths\n## [1] \"x -&gt; y\"      \"x &lt;- a -&gt; y\" \"x &lt;- b -&gt; y\"\n## \n## $open\n## [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE\n\n\nThe first open path is fine—we want a single d-connected relationship between treatment and outcome—but the other two indicate that there is confounding from a and b. We can see what each of these paths are with the ggdag_paths() function from the ggdag package:\n\n\nCode\nggdag_paths(simple_dag_with_coords) +\n  theme_dag()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of listing out all the possible paths and identifying backdoors by hand, you can use the adjustmentSets() function in the dagitty package to programmatically find all the nodes that need to be adjusted. Here we see that both a and b need to be controlled for to isolate the x -&gt; y relationship.\n\n\nCode\nadjustmentSets(simple_dag)\n## { a, b }\n\n\nYou can also visualize the adjustment sets with ggdag_adjustment_set() in the ggdag package. Make sure you set shadow = TRUE to draw the arrows coming out of the adjusted nodes—by default, those are not included.\n\n\nCode\nggdag_adjustment_set(simple_dag_with_coords, shadow = TRUE) +\n  theme_dag()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR will find minimally sufficient adjustment sets, which includes the fewest number of adjustments needed to close all backdoors between x and y. In this example DAG there was only one set of variables (a and b), but in other situations there could be many possible sets, or none if the causal effect is not identifiable.\n\n\nPlot DAG from dagitty.net with ggdag()\nIf you use dagitty.net to draw a DAG, you’ll notice that it generates some code for you in the model code section:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can copy that dag{ ... } code and paste it into R to define a DAG object rather than use the dagify() function. To do this, use the dagitty() function from the dagitty library and include the whole generated model code in single quotes (''):\n\n\nCode\nmodel_from_dagitty &lt;- dagitty('dag {\nbb=\"0,0,1,1\"\n\"A confounder\" [pos=\"0.809,0.306\"]\n\"Another confounder\" [pos=\"0.810,0.529\"]\n\"Some outcome\" [outcome,pos=\"0.918,0.432\"]\n\"Some treatment\" [exposure,pos=\"0.681,0.426\"]\n\"A confounder\" -&gt; \"Some outcome\"\n\"A confounder\" -&gt; \"Some treatment\"\n\"Another confounder\" -&gt; \"Some outcome\"\n\"Another confounder\" -&gt; \"Some treatment\"\n\"Some treatment\" -&gt; \"Some outcome\"\n}\n')\n\nggdag(model_from_dagitty) +\n  theme_dag()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default it’s going to look ugly because (1) the node labels don’t fit, and (2) slight differences in the coordinates make it so the nodes don’t perfectly align with each other. To fix coordinate alignment, you can modify the numbers in the generated DAG code. Here I rounded the numbers so that they’re all 0.3, 0.8, etc.\nTo fix the label issue, you can add the use_labels argument like normally. Only here, you can’t specify use_labels = \"label\". Instead, when you specify a DAG using dagitty’s code like this, the column in the underlying dataset that contains the labels is named name, so you need to use use_labels = \"name\".\nOther ggdag() variations like ggdag_status() will still work fine.\n\n\nCode\nmodel_from_dagitty_rounded &lt;- dagitty('dag {\nbb=\"0,0,1,1\"\n\"A confounder\" [pos=\"0.8,0.3\"]\n\"Another confounder\" [pos=\"0.8,0.5\"]\n\"Some outcome\" [outcome,pos=\"0.9,0.4\"]\n\"Some treatment\" [exposure,pos=\"0.7,0.4\"]\n\"A confounder\" -&gt; \"Some outcome\"\n\"A confounder\" -&gt; \"Some treatment\"\n\"Another confounder\" -&gt; \"Some outcome\"\n\"Another confounder\" -&gt; \"Some treatment\"\n\"Some treatment\" -&gt; \"Some outcome\"\n}\n')\n\nggdag_status(model_from_dagitty_rounded, text = FALSE, use_labels = \"name\") +\n  guides(color = \"none\") +  # Turn off legend\n  theme_dag()"

    "section": "Mosquito net example",
    "text": "Mosquito net example\n\nConditional independencies\nYou can test if your stated relationships are correct by looking at the conditional independencies that are implied by the DAG. In dagitty.net, these appear in the sidebar in the “Testable implications” section. To show how this works, we’ll use a simulated dataset that I generated about a fictional mosquito net program. Download the data here if you want to follow along:\n\n mosquito_nets.csv\n\nResearchers are interested in whether using mosquito nets decreases an individual’s risk of contracting malaria. They have collected data from 1,752 households in an unnamed country and have variables related to environmental factors, individual health, and household characteristics. Additionally, this country has a special government program that provides free mosquito nets to households that meet specific requirements: to qualify for the program, there must be more than 4 members of the household, and the household’s monthly income must be lower than $700 a month. Households are not automatically enrolled in the program, and many do not use it. The data is not experimental—researchers have no control over who uses mosquito nets, and individual households make their own choices over whether to apply for free nets or buy their own nets, as well as whether they use the nets if they have them.\n\n\nCode\nmosquito_dag &lt;- dagify(\n  malaria_risk ~ net + income + health + temperature + resistance,\n  net ~ income + health + temperature + eligible + household,\n  eligible ~ income + household,\n  health ~ income,\n  exposure = \"net\",\n  outcome = \"malaria_risk\",\n  coords = list(x = c(malaria_risk = 7, net = 3, income = 4, health = 5,\n                      temperature = 6, resistance = 8.5, eligible = 2, household = 1),\n                y = c(malaria_risk = 2, net = 2, income = 3, health = 1,\n                      temperature = 3, resistance = 2, eligible = 3, household = 2)),\n  labels = c(malaria_risk = \"Risk of malaria\", net = \"Mosquito net\", income = \"Income\",\n             health = \"Health\", temperature = \"Nighttime temperatures\",\n             resistance = \"Insecticide resistance\",\n             eligible = \"Eligible for program\", household = \"Number in household\")\n)\n\nggdag_status(mosquito_dag, use_labels = \"label\", text = FALSE) +\n  guides(fill = \"none\", color = \"none\") +  # Disable the legend\n  theme_dag()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe causal graph above outlines the complete relationship between mosquito net use and risk of malaria. Each node in the DAG is a column in the dataset collected by the researchers, and includes the following:\n\nMalaria risk (malaria_risk): The likelihood that someone in the household will be infected with malaria. Measured on a scale of 0–100, with higher values indicating higher risk.\nMosquito net (net and net_num): A binary variable indicating if the household used mosquito nets.\nEligible for program (eligible): A binary variable indicating if the household is eligible for the free net program.\nIncome (income): The household’s monthly income, in US dollars.\nNighttime temperatures (temperature): The average temperature at night, in Celsius.\nHealth (health): Self-reported healthiness in the household. Measured on a scale of 0–100, with higher values indicating better health.\nNumber in household (household): Number of people living in the household.\nInsecticide resistance (resistance): Some strains of mosquitoes are more resistant to insecticide and thus pose a higher risk of infecting people with malaria. This is measured on a scale of 0–100, with higher values indicating higher resistance.\n\nAccording to the DAG, malaria risk is caused by income, temperatures, health, insecticide resistance, and mosquito net use. People who live in hotter regions, have lower incomes, have worse health, are surrounded by mosquitoes with high resistance to insecticide, and who do not use mosquito nets are at higher risk of contracting malaria than those who do not. Mosquito net use is caused by income, nighttime temperatures, health, the number of people living in the house, and eligibility for the free net program. People who live in areas that are cooler at night, have higher incomes, have better health, have more people in the home, and are eligible for free government nets are more likely to regularly use nets than those who do not. The DAG also shows that eligibility for the free net program is caused by income and household size, since households must meet specific thresholds to qualify.\nFirst, let’s download the dataset, put in a folder named data, and load it:\n\n mosquito_nets.csv\n\n\n\nCode\n# Load the data.\n# It'd be a good idea to click on the \"mosquito_nets.csv\" object in the\n# Environment panel in RStudio to see what the data looks like after you load it\nmosquito_nets &lt;- read_csv(\"data/mosquito_nets.csv\")\n\n\nWe can use this data to check if the relationships defined by our DAG reflect reality. Recall that d-separation implies that nodes are statistically independent of each other and do not transfer associational information. If you draw the mosquito net DAG with dagitty.net, or if you run impliedConditionalIndependencies() in R, you can see a list of all the implied conditional independencies.\n\n\nCode\nimpliedConditionalIndependencies(mosquito_dag)\n## elgb _||_ hlth | incm\n## elgb _||_ mlr_ | hlth, incm, net, tmpr\n## elgb _||_ rsst\n## elgb _||_ tmpr\n## hlth _||_ hshl\n## hlth _||_ rsst\n## hlth _||_ tmpr\n## hshl _||_ incm\n## hshl _||_ mlr_ | hlth, incm, net, tmpr\n## hshl _||_ rsst\n## hshl _||_ tmpr\n## incm _||_ rsst\n## incm _||_ tmpr\n## net _||_ rsst\n## rsst _||_ tmpr\n\n\nThe _||_ symbol in the output here is the \\(\\perp\\) symbol, which means “independent of”. The | in the output means “given”.\nIn the interest of space, we will not verify all these implied independencies, but we can test a few of them:\n\n\\(\\text{Health} \\perp \\text{Household members}\\): (Read as “Health is independent of household member count”.) Health should be independent of the number of people in each household. In the data, the two variables should not be correlated. This is indeed the case:\n\n\nCode\ncor(mosquito_nets$health, mosquito_nets$household)\n## [1] 9.8e-05\n\n\n\\(\\text{Income} \\perp \\text{Insecticide resistance}\\): (Read as “Income is independent of insecticide resistance”.) Income should be independent of insecticide resistance. This is again true:\n\n\nCode\ncor(mosquito_nets$income, mosquito_nets$resistance)\n## [1] 0.014\n\n\n\\(\\text{Malaria risk} \\perp \\text{Household members}\\ |\\ \\text{Health, Income, Bed net use, Temperature}\\): (Read as “Malaria risk is independent of house member count given health, income, bed net use, and temperature”.) Malaria risk should be independent of the number of household members given similar levels of health, income, mosquito net use, and nighttime temperatures. We cannot use cor() to test this implication, since there are many variables involved, but we can use a regression model to check if the number of household members is significantly related to malaria risk. It is not significant (\\(t = -0.17\\), \\(p = 0.863\\)), which means the two are independent, as expected.\n\n\nCode\nlm(malaria_risk ~ household + health + income + net + temperature,\n   data = mosquito_nets) %&gt;%\n  broom::tidy()\n## # A tibble: 6 × 5\n##   term        estimate std.error statistic   p.value\n##   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n## 1 (Intercept)  76.2      0.966      78.9   0        \n## 2 household    -0.0155   0.0893     -0.173 8.63e-  1\n## 3 health        0.148    0.0107     13.9   9.75e- 42\n## 4 income       -0.0751   0.00104   -72.6   0        \n## 5 netTRUE     -10.4      0.266     -39.2   2.63e-241\n## 6 temperature   1.01     0.0310     32.5   1.88e-181\n\n\n\nWe can check all the other conditional independencies to see if the DAG captures the reality of the full system of factors that influence mosquito net use and malaria risk. If there are substantial and significant correlations between nodes that should be independent, there is likely an issue with the specification of the DAG. Return to the theory of how the phenomena are generated and refine the DAG more.\n\n\nMosquito net adjustment sets\nThere is a direct path between mosquito net use and the risk of malaria, but the effect is not causally identified due to several other open paths. We can either list out all the paths and find which open paths have arrows pointing backwards into the mosquito net node (run paths(mosquito_dag) to see these results), or we can let R find the appropriate adjustment sets automatically:\n\n\nCode\nadjustmentSets(mosquito_dag)\n## { health, income, temperature }\n\n\nBased on the relationships between all the nodes in the DAG, adjusting for health, income, and temperature is enough to close all backdoors and identify the relationship between net use and malaria risk. Importantly, we do not need to worry about any of the nodes related to the government program for free nets, since those nodes are not d-connected to malaria risk. We only need to worry about confounding relationships.\nWe can confirm this graphically with ggdag_adjustment_set():\n\n\nCode\nggdag_adjustment_set(mosquito_dag, shadow = TRUE,\n                     use_labels = \"label\", text = FALSE) +\n  theme_dag()"

    "text": "Because RStudio projects typically consist of multiple files (R scripts, datasets, graphical output, etc.) the easiest way to distribute them to you for examples, assignments, and projects is to combine all the different files in to a single compressed collection called a zip file. When you unzip a zipped file, your operating system extracts all the files that are contained inside into a new folder on your computer.\nUnzipping files on macOS is trivial, but unzipping files on Windows can mess you up if you don’t pay careful attention. Here’s a helpful guide to unzipping files on both macOS and Windows.",

    "text": "Unzipping files on Windows\ntl;dr: Right click on the .zip file, select “Extract All…”, and work with the resulting unzipped folder.\nUnlike macOS, Windows does not automatically unzip things for you. If you double click on the .zip file, Windows will show you what’s inside, but it will do so without actually extracting anything. This can be is incredibly confusing! Here’s what it looks like—the only clues that this folder is really a .zip file are that there’s a “Compressed Folder Tools” tab at the top, and there’s a “Ratio” column that shows how much each file is compressed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is very tempting to try to open files from this view. However, if you do, things will break and you won’t be able to correctly work with any of the files in the zipped folder. If you open the R Project file, for instance, RStudio will point to a bizarre working directory buried deep in some temporary folder:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou most likely won’t be able to open any data files or save anything, which will be frustrating.\nInstead, you need to right click on the .zip file and select “Extract All…”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen choose where you want to unzip all the files and click on “Extract”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should then finally have a real folder with all the contents of the zipped file. Open the R Project file and RStudio will point to the correct working directory and everything will work.",

Since we used a uniform prior, the posterior is proportional to the likelihood. The peak of the distribution is around p = 0.21, which makes sense given our data (3/14 ≈ 0.21).\n\n\nUsing the posterior distribution from 1, compute the posterior predictive distribution for the next 5 tosses of the globe.\n\n\n\nClick to see the answer\n\n\n# Number of samples from posterior\nn_samples &lt;- 10000\n\n# Sample p values from posterior\np_samples &lt;- sample(p_grid, prob = posterior, size = n_samples, replace = TRUE)\n\n# Generate predictions for 5 tosses\nn_tosses &lt;- 5\npredictions &lt;- rbinom(n_samples, size = n_tosses, prob = p_samples)\n\n# Plot the posterior predictive distribution\nhist(predictions, \n     xlab = \"Number of water in 5 tosses\",\n     ylab = \"Count\",\n     main = \"Posterior predictive distribution\",\n     breaks = seq(-0.5, 5.5, by = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe posterior predictive distribution shows the probability of different outcomes for the next 5 tosses, taking into account our uncertainty about p. The most likely outcome is 1 water (since our posterior mean for p is around 0.21, we expect about 1 water in 5 tosses). The distribution is right-skewed because p is less than 0.5.\n\nYou can download a template file here to help you get started."

The syntax for these pivot_*() functions is slightly different from what it was in gather() and spread(), so you can’t just replace the names. Fortunately, both gather() and spread() still work and won’t go away for a while, so you can still use them as you learn about reshaping and tidying data. It would be worth learning how the newer pivot_*() functions work, eventually, though (see here for examples).\n\n\nThe content from these primers comes from the (free and online!) book R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.

    "section": "Part 3: RStudio Projects",
    "text": "Part 3: RStudio Projects\nOne of the most powerful and useful aspects of RStudio is its ability to manage projects.\nWhen you first open R, it is “pointed” at some folder on your computer, and anything you do will be relative to that folder. The technical term for this is a “working directory.”\nWhen you first open RStudio, look in the area right at the top of the Console pane to see your current working directory. Most likely you’ll see something cryptic: ~/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat tilde sign (~) is a shortcut that stands for your user directory. On Windows this is C:\\Users\\your_user_name\\; on macOS this is /Users/your_user_name/. With the working directory set to ~/, R is “pointed” at that folder, and anything you save will end up in that folder, and R will expect any data that you load to be there too.\nIt’s always best to point R at some other directory. If you don’t use RStudio, you need to manually set the working directory to where you want it with setwd(), and many R scripts in the wild include something like setwd(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\bill\\\\Desktop\\\\Important research project\") at the beginning to change the directory. THIS IS BAD THOUGH (see here for an explanation). If you ever move that directory somewhere else, or run the script on a different computer, or share the project with someone, the path will be wrong and nothing will run and you will be sad.\nThe best way to deal with working directories with RStudio is to use RStudio Projects. These are special files that RStudio creates for you that end in a .Rproj extension. When you open one of these special files, a new RStudio instance will open up and be pointed at the correct directory automatically. If you move the folder later or open it on a different computer, it will work just fine and you will not be sad.\nRead this super short chapter on RStudio projects to learn how to create and use them\nIn general, you can create a new project by going to File &gt; New Project &gt; New Directory &gt; Empty Project, which will create a new folder on your computer that is empty except for a single .Rproj file. Double click on that file to open an RStudio instance that is pointed at the correct folder."

I will make an effort to respond to emails within one business day. Note that I neither plan nor commit to checking email outside of normal business hours (9am-5pm, Mon-Fri).\nIf you are having trouble understanding a concept covered in class, please come to office hours, schedule a meeting with me, ask for clarification during class periods, or use the class Slack to get help from the group. I will not explain course concepts over email.\nOccasionally, I will send out announcements to the entire class via Canvas announcements. These will typically appear when you open Canvas, but you can update your Canvas settings to receive these announcements as emails. It is strongly recommended that you do so.\n\n\nClassroom Expectations\nAll members of the class (students and instructor) can expect to:\nParticipate and Contribute: All students are expected to participate by sharing ideas and contributing to the learning environment. This entails preparing, following instructions, and engaging respectfully and thoughtfully with others.\nWhile all students should participate, participation is not just talking, and a range of participation activities support learning. Participation might look like speaking aloud in the full class and in small groups and collaborating on homework assignments.\nExpect and Respect Diversity: All classes at the University of Oregon welcome and respect diverse experiences, perspectives, and approaches. What is not welcome are behaviors or contributions that undermine, demean, or marginalize others based on race, ethnicity, gender, sex, age, sexual orientation, religion, ability, or socioeconomic status. We will value differences and communicate disagreements with respect.\nHelp Everyone Learn: Part of how we learn together is by learning from one another. To do this effectively, we need to be patient with each other, identify ways we can assist others, and be open-minded to receiving help and feedback from others. Don’t hesitate to contact me to ask for assistance or offer suggestions that might help us learn better.\n\n\nWorkload\nThis is a 3-credit hour course, so you should expect to complete 120 hours of work for the course—an average of about 12 hours each week (this includes time in-class).\n\n\nGenerative AI Policy\nWhile generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Cursor) can be useful for assisting with certain tasks, it’s important to use these technologies responsibly and ethically.\nGood uses of AI:\n\nExploring concepts, generating code ideas, and providing explanations for topics covered in the course\nCreating preliminary drafts of code, data analysis plans, or written reports (with review and testing)\nBrainstorming research questions, identifying key terms, or helping summarize complex literature\n\nBad uses of AI:\n\nGenerating entire assignments, projects, or reports without manual oversight\nUsing AI in place of collaborating with peers\nSubmitting AI-generated content without proper attribution\n\nRequired Disclosure: Students who use AI tools must include a brief statement at the end of their submission describing how and where the tool was used. Failure to disclose AI use may result in grade reduction or disciplinary action.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nFrankly, you’re in graduate school, and the purpose of work is to create opportunities to learn and improve. Even if cheating helps you in the short term, you’ll quickly find yourself ill-prepared for the career you have chosen. If you find yourself tempted to cheat, please come speak to Dr. Weston about an extension and developing tools to improve your success.\n\n\nAccessibility\nThe University of Oregon and I are dedicated to fostering inclusive learning environments for all students and welcomes students with disabilities into all of the University’s educational programs. The Accessible Education Center (AEC) assists students with disabilities in reducing campus-wide and classroom-related barriers. If you have or think you have a disability (https://aec.uoregon.edu/content/what-disability) and experience academic barriers, please contact the AEC to discuss appropriate accommodations or support. Visit 360 Oregon Hall or aec.uoregon.edu for more information. You can contact AEC at 541-346-1155 or via email at uoaec@uoregon.edu.\n\n\nBasic Needs\nBeing able to meet your basic needs is foundational to your success as a student at the University of Oregon. If you are having difficulty affording food, don’t have a stable, safe place to live, or are struggling to meet another need, visit the UO Basic Needs Resource page for information on how to get support. They have information food, housing, healthcare, childcare, transportation, technology, finances (including emergency funds), and legal support.\nIf your need is urgent, please contact the Care and Advocacy Program by calling 541-346-3216, filling out the Community Care and Support form, or by scheduling an appointment with an advocate.\n\n\nReporting Obligations\nI am a designated reporter. For information about my reporting obligations as an employee, please see Employee Reporting Obligations on the Office of Investigations and Civil Rights Compliance (OICRC) website. Students experiencing sex- or gender-based discrimination, harassment or violence should call the 24-7 hotline 541-346-SAFE [7244] or visit safe.uoregon.edu for help. Students experiencing all forms of prohibited discrimination or harassment may contact the Dean of Students Office at 541-346-3216 or the non-confidential Title IX Coordinator/OICRC at 541-346-3123 to request information and resources. Students are not required to participate in an investigation to receive support, including requesting academic supportive measures. Additional resources are available at investigations.uoregon.edu/how-get-support.\nI am also a mandatory reporter of child abuse.

To use math inline, wrap it in single dollar signs, like $y = mx + b$:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType…\n\n\n…to get\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the DAG, the regression model for\nestimating the effect of education on wages\nis $\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\epsilon$, \nor $\\text{Wages} = \\beta_0 + \n\\beta_1 \\text{Education} + \\epsilon$.\n\n\nBased on the DAG, the regression model for estimating the effect of education on wages is \\(\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\epsilon\\), or \\(\\text{Wages} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{Education} + \\epsilon\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing math in a block\nTo put an equation on its own line in a display block, wrap it in double dollar signs, like this:\nType…\nThe quadratic equation was a way to solve for $x$ in high school math:\n\n$$\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n$$\n…to get…\n\nThe quadratic equation was a way to solve for \\(x\\) in high school math:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nDollar signs and math\nBecause dollar signs are used to indicate math equations, you can’t just use dollar signs like normal if you’re writing about actual dollars. For instance, if you write This book costs $5.75 and this other costs $40, Markdown will treat everything that comes between the dollar signs as math, like so: “This book costs \\($5.75 and this other costs $40\\)”.\nTo get around that, put a backslash (\\) in front of the dollar signs, so that This book costs \\$5.75 and this other costs \\$40 becomes “This book costs $5.75 and this other costs $40”.",

I typically use quotes just to be safe—if the value you’re using has a colon (:) in it, it’ll confuse Markdown since it’ll be something like title: My cool title: a subtitle, which has two colons. It’s better to do this:\n---\ntitle: \"My cool title: a subtitle\"\n---\nIf you want to use quotes inside one of the values (e.g. your document is An evaluation of \"scare quotes\"), you can use single quotes instead:\n---\ntitle: 'An evaluation of \"scare quotes\"'\n---",

    "text": "Citations\nOne of the most powerful features of Markdown + pandoc is the ability to automatically cite things and generate bibliographies. to use citations, you need to create a BibTeX file (ends in .bib) that contains a database of the things you want to cite. You can do this with bibliography managers designed to work with BibTeX directly (like BibDesk on macOS), or you can use Zotero (macOS and Windows) to export a .bib file. You can download an example .bib file of all the readings from this class here.\nComplete details for using citations can be found here. In brief, you need to do three things:\n\nAdd a bibliography: entry to the YAML metadata:\n---\ntitle: Title of your document\ndate: \"January 13, 2020\"\nauthor: \"Your name\"\nbibliography: name_of_file.bib\n---\nChoose a citation style based on a CSL file. The default is Chicago author-date, but you can choose from 2,000+ at this repository. Download the CSL file, put it in your project folder, and add an entry to the YAML metadata (or provide a URL to the online version):\n---\ntitle: Title of your document\ndate: \"January 13, 2020\"\nauthor: \"Your name\"\nbibliography: name_of_file.bib\ncsl: \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/apa.csl\"\n---\nSome of the most common CSLs are:\n\nChicago author-date\nChicago note-bibliography\nChicago full note-bibliography (no shortened notes or ibids)\nAPA 7th edition\nMLA 8th edition\n\nCite things in your document.

    "text": "Questions\nFrom the Howell1 dataset, consider only people younger than 13 years old. Estimate the causal association between age and weight. Assume that age influences weight through two paths. First, age influences height, and height influences weight. Second, age directly influences weight through age-related changes in muscle growth and body proportions.\n\nDraw the DAG that represents these causal relationships.\n\n\n\nClick to see the answer\n\n\n# Load required packages\nlibrary(dagitty)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Create the DAG\ndag &lt;- dagitty(\"dag {\n  A [age]\n  H [height]\n  W [weight]\n  A -&gt; H\n  H -&gt; W\n  A -&gt; W\n}\")\n\n# Plot the DAG\nplot(dag)\n\nPlot coordinates for graph not supplied! Generating coordinates, see ?coordinates for how to set your own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe DAG shows three variables (age, height, and weight) with directed edges representing causal relationships. There are two paths from age to weight: 1. A direct path: age → weight (representing age-related changes in muscle growth and body proportions) 2. An indirect path: age → height → weight (representing the influence of age on height, which then affects weight)\n\n\nWrite a generative simulation that takes age as an input and simulates height and weight, obeying the relationships in the DAG.\n\n\n\nClick to see the answer\n\n\nset.seed(1)\n# Function to simulate data\n# i'm using feet/pounds, but you can stick with metric if you prefer\nsimulate_growth &lt;- function(age, bAH=0.35, bHW=5, bAW=5) {\n  N &lt;- length(age) # num individuals\n  # simulate heights (caused by age plus variation)\n  height &lt;- rnorm(N, bAH*age, .2) \n  # simulate heights (caused by age and height plus variation)\n  weight &lt;- rnorm(N, bAW*age + bHW*height, 4) \n  #return data frame\n  data.frame(age, height, weight)\n  \n}\n\nsim = simulate_growth( runif(n=20, min=1, max=12)  )\n\npar(mfrow = c(1, 3))\nplot(sim$age, sim$height)\nplot(sim$age, sim$weight)\nplot(sim$height, sim$weight)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis simulation: 1. Takes age as input 2. Generates height using a function of age 3. Generates weight as a function of both age (direct effect) and height (indirect effect) 4. Includes random variation (noise) in both height and weight\nThe plots show the expected relationships: both height and weight increase with age and height and weight are linearlly related.\n\n\nEstimate the total causal effect of each year of growth on weight.

To make life easier, you can (and should!) use the free RStudio.cloud service initially, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This means you won’t have to install anything on your computer to get started with R! We will have a shared class workspace in RStudio.cloud that will let you quickly copy templates for labs and problem sets.\nGo to https://rstudio.cloud/ and create an account. You’ll receive a link to join the shared class workspace separately. If you don’t get this link, let me know and I will invite you.",

    "text": "RStudio on your computer\nRStudio.cloud is convenient, but it can be slow and it is not designed to be able to handle larger datasets, more complicated analysis, or fancier graphics. Over the course of the semester, you should wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud and install all these things locally. This is also important if you want to customize fonts, since RStudio.cloud has extremely limited support for fonts other than Helvetica.\nHere’s how you install all these things\n\nInstall R\nFirst you need to install R itself (the engine).\n\nGo to the CRAN (Collective R Archive Network)1 website: https://cran.r-project.org/\nClick on “Download R for XXX”, where XXX is either Mac or Windows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use macOS, scroll down to the first .pkg file in the list of files (in this picture, it’s R-4.0.0.pkg; as of right now, the current version is 4.2.1) and download it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use Windows, click “base” (or click on the bolded “install R for the first time” link) and download it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble click on the downloaded file (check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\nIf you use macOS, download and install XQuartz. You do not need to do this on Windows.\n\n\n\nInstall RStudio\nNext, you need to install RStudio, the nicer graphical user interface (GUI) for R (the dashboard). Once R and RStudio are both installed, you can ignore R and only use RStudio. RStudio will use R automatically and you won’t ever have to interact with it directly.\n\nGo to the free download location on RStudio’s website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\nThe website should automatically detect your operating system (macOS or Windows) and show a big download button for it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf not, scroll down a little to the large table and choose the version of RStudio that matches your operating system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble click on the downloaded file (again, check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n\nDouble click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).\n\n\nInstall tidyverse\nR packages are easy to install with RStudio. Select the packages panel, click on “Install,” type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can sometimes be tedious when you’re installing lots of packages, though. The tidyverse, for instance, consists of dozens of packages (including ggplot2) that all work together. Rather than install each individually, you can install a single magical package and get them all at the same time.\nGo to the packages panel in RStudio, click on “Install,” type “tidyverse”, and press enter. You’ll see a bunch of output in the RStudio console as all the tidyverse packages are installed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice also that RStudio will generate a line of code for you and run it: install.packages(\"tidyverse\"). You can also just paste and run this instead of using the packages panel.\n\n\nInstall tinytex\nWhen you knit to PDF, R uses a special scientific typesetting program named LaTeX (pronounced “lay-tek” or “lah-tex”; for goofy nerdy reasons, the x is technically the “ch” sound in “Bach”, but most people just say it as “k”—saying “layteks” is frowned on for whatever reason).\nLaTeX is neat and makes pretty documents, but it’s a huge program—the macOS version, for instance, is nearly 4 GB! To make life easier, there’s an R package named tinytex that installs a minimal LaTeX program and that automatically deals with differences between macOS and Windows.\nHere’s how to install tinytex so you can knit to pretty PDFs:\n\nUse the Packages in panel in RStudio to install tinytex like you did above with tidyverse. Alternatively, run install.packages(\"tinytex\") in the console.\nRun tinytex::install_tinytex() in the console.\nWait for a bit while R downloads and installs everything you need.\nThe end! You should now be able to knit to PDF.",

A good suggestion is to keep lines at a maximum of 80 characters. Instead of counting characters by hand (ew), in RStudio go to “Tools” &gt; “Global Options” &gt; “Code” &gt; “Display” and check the box for “Show margin”. You should now see a really thin line indicating 80 characters. Again, you can go beyond this—that’s fine. It’s just good practice to avoid going too far past it.\nYou can add line breaks inside longer lines of code. Line breaks should come after commas, and things like function arguments should align within the function:\n\n# Good\nfilter(mpg, cty &gt; 10, class == \"compact\")\n\n# Good\nfilter(mpg, cty &gt; 10, \n       class == \"compact\")\n\n# Good\nfilter(mpg,\n       cty &gt; 10,\n       class == \"compact\")\n\n# Bad\nfilter(mpg, cty &gt; 10, class %in% c(\"compact\", \"pickup\", \"midsize\", \"subcompact\", \"suv\", \"2seater\", \"minivan\"))\n\n# Good\nfilter(mpg, \n       cty &gt; 10, \n       class %in% c(\"compact\", \"pickup\", \"midsize\", \"subcompact\", \n                    \"suv\", \"2seater\", \"minivan\"))\n\n\n\nPipes (%&gt;%) and ggplot layers (+)\nPut each layer of a ggplot plot on separate lines, with the + at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:\n\n# Good\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth() +\n  theme_bw()\n\n# Bad\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) +\n  geom_point() + geom_smooth() +\n  theme_bw()\n\n# Super bad\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw()\n\n# Super bad and won't even work\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class))\n  + geom_point()\n  + geom_smooth() \n  + theme_bw()\n\nPut each step in a dplyr pipeline on separate lines, with the %&gt;% at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:\n\n# Good\nmpg %&gt;% \n  filter(cty &gt; 10) %&gt;% \n  group_by(class) %&gt;% \n  summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))\n\n# Bad\nmpg %&gt;% filter(cty &gt; 10) %&gt;% group_by(class) %&gt;% \n  summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))\n\n# Super bad\nmpg %&gt;% filter(cty &gt; 10) %&gt;% group_by(class) %&gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))\n\n# Super bad and won't even work\nmpg %&gt;% \n  filter(cty &gt; 10)\n  %&gt;% group_by(class)\n  %&gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))\n\n\n\nComments\n\nSee the “Comments” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n\nComments should start with a comment symbol and a single space: #\n\n# Good\n\n#Bad\n\n    #Bad\n\nIf the comment is really short (and won’t cause you to go over 80 characters in the line), you can include it in the same line as the code, separated by at least two spaces (it works with one space, but using a couple can enhance readability):\n\nmpg %&gt;% \n  filter(cty &gt; 10) %&gt;%  # Only rows where cty is 10 +\n  group_by(class) %&gt;%  # Divide into class groups\n  summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))  # Find the average hwy in each group\n\nYou can add extra spaces to get inline comments to align, if you want:\n\nmpg %&gt;% \n  filter(cty &gt; 10) %&gt;%            # Only rows where cty is 10 +\n  group_by(class) %&gt;%             # Divide into class groups\n  summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))  # Find the average hwy in each group\n\nIf the comment is really long, you can break it into multiple lines. RStudio can do this for you if you go to “Code” &gt; “Reflow comment”\n\n# Good\n# Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\n# Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys’ house.
